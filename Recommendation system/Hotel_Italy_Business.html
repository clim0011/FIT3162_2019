we had booked via Booking com We knew about the additional city tax of course but they had entered the wrong rates on the system Unfortunately we only noticed after the payment had gone through at which point the receptionist who admitted the mistake told us that refunds could only be processed centrally but someone would be in touch the next day I have since then emailed the hotel twice to request a refund but have not even received a reply They also tried to charge us for the minibar which was included in the room rate we did spot that one in time so I do wonder whether accidental

usual prize This so on the reception because the hotel was almost full and prizes are going up consequently I think this is a real shame because we were at the level of a five star top hotel like the

get a room where the air condition did not work I needed to solicit two times on the reception and answer the attendant is busy please be patient When he came he told only that some valve is obstructed and that he cannot do anything So we were forced to sleep in a hot room resulting in a sweatiness during all the night No thanks not for this prize For such prize I ve could book a 5 star

to the beautiful Stazione Centrale I have stayed in many hotels in this area and the Glam is by far the best Most hotels in and around the area are traditional and therefore lack the modern amenities

table when I returned with my dessert and told her I wasn t finished yet She just said It s okay and left after clearing the table I was speechless for a few minutes at the response The guests understood the awkward situation and moved to another table and I finished my dessert without a towel cutlery and in extreme embarrassement Please train your staff to respond better to guests And hey

told that an engineer was going to sort it but the problem was still there all of the next day with a lot of rattling in the pipes I understand that this happens but the communication of the problem

location right at the beautiful train station very modern interior rooms were spotless rooms came with half board which made the room price very reasonable place felt brand new</br></br>Negative: no complaints at all </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Germany </br></br>Positive:  I ve been saying at this hotel 4 times now My main reason for choosing it is the convenient location and the clean comfortable rooms It s a new hotel and that makes a difference I recently discovered the half board offering and I am very pleased I read a few negative comments regarding the food which I don t understand maybe because I m Vegetarian There are plenty of choices of warm dishes salads and vegetables fruits and cheeses for the price of this hotel you would normally not get half board For a business traveler it is great for someone looking for a romantic dinner with table service don t expect that here but explore the cities options I also like the breakfast and the option of soy milk yogurt </br></br>Negative: No complaints not my favourite neighbourhood in Milan but convenient Maybe a gym would be nice or did I miss that </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Cyprus </br></br>Positive:  I liked the room and view Clean and nice At reception everyone was friendly helpful and polite Hotel is new and everything is in good condition </br></br>Negative: I didn t like dinner at all and restaurant there Dinner was included but food wasn t tasty and enough Sometimes the plates even were empty and you had to wait when at list anything will appear at Sweden table The staff at restaurant worked like you are not there or not important they spoke loud about their own interest and could tell you not to sit at some tables and wait when they will clean another </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Canada </br></br>Positive:  The hotel is a relatively new and is conveniently located near the Milan central station I stayed in the Standard Double Room which overall I enjoyed The room is a good size and the setup is nice as the bed is comfortable and there are plenty of electric sockets and lighting throughout the room The room also has a flat screen TV which has CNN and some other English TV stations Other things that are important which I enjoyed about the room is that the heating and air conditioning worked well it has nice big windows the bathroom had heated towel racks and the bathroom products are of good quality I found all the staff to be excellent from the reception to the doorman to the people who work at the bar and restaurant more specifically I found the staff to be young energetic attentive and nice Another great thing is that the WIFI worked well throughout the hotel as it is fast and easy to log onto which is important especially if you are travelling for business The breakfast buffet has a good selection and is convenient because it runs until 11 30am furthermore if there is something that you want that is not part of the breakfast buffet the staff is there to provide you with what you want directly from the kitchen Overall the hotel offers great value is clean and has a modern look and feel I would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay there again as I am a frequent traveller to Milan and have stayed in many hotels there </br></br>Negative: I like the modern set up of the bathroom however the bathtub shower may be a little difficult to get into if you have some mobility issues as it would be helpful if there was a step Also the setup of the shower door does not work very well because if you take a shower and use the overhead showerhead the bathroom floor will likely be full of water Also the hotel is missing a business as well as a fitness centre however if you need documents printed the staff at the front desk is more than willing to accommodate your needs </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Russia </br></br>Positive:  Friendly and fast check in great room very fresh and clean The

expensive The staff Provided also gluten free bread and in the morning they remembered I am celiac and gave me gluten free breakfast </br></br>Negative: The lights in the room are generally too dark the bathrooms are black and the light is too weak I like it for relaxing but not for you know makeup </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Oman </br></br>Positive:  Execellent location Entry to Metro

the room number this makes breakfast to a stressy situation Breakfastroom is strange divided i think in 3 rooms PLEASE FIRST let guests SIT DOWN and THEN ask for number AND PLEASE be quiet The staff

Paris Vienna you will have better service and Spa and Fitness here is NOTHING </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Greece </br></br>Positive:  Perfect location Nice view Nice breakfast Actually on the Metro station </br></br>Negative: Hotel s reception gave me a Standard Double Room instead of Junior Suite that I booked even I show them my reservation receipt from Booking When I figured out the deception I called the reception and they immediately upgraded my room to the Junior Suite that I have booked and they apologized but this was unacceptable for a 4 stars hotel The cue at the reception </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Netherlands </br></br>Positive:  The location was accessible to many trains and metros Breakfast was very complete and was available early </br></br>Negative: Staff could have been more helpful in terms of getting around the city Also I would prefer to have a No not disturb sign but this was unavailable even after asking the front desk </br><hr>Nationality of

the lighting and furniture fair in Milan which is organized every 2 years and we always choose your hotel as our first choice because I expected that the Rosa Grand Star hotel should be able to provide us both comfortable and safety with the best hospitality Unfortunately my decision was wrong There was not comfortable it was the poorest hospitality that I even had in my experiences and the worst is very insecure Since first day of my visit the hotel guest service at the counter was impolite and not helpful We booked two rooms close to each other because of my father health and disability The front desk told us that if we would like to get two rooms on the same floor we have to pay additional 50 euro per night and that was totally fine for us However it was so early to check in at that time so they told us to be back later Once we were back the front desk told us that there were not two rooms available on the same floor and it might be misunderstanding After a long discussion finally we got the room on the 6th floor room 604 and 605 the rooms that were under graded than our booking but it was fine for me at least we can stay in the same floor and I was very tried already At our second day there was glass broken by accident in my mother s room and I called the hotel receptionist to help me to get house keeper to clean the broken glasses I was waiting in the room for the housekeeper for a long time because I was afraid the housekeeper might step on the broken glasses without notice it and she might get hurt I waited and waited but no one shown up So I

machine was great with 4 capsules to chose from </br></br>Negative: 1 The room location was much to be desired 440 is located at the far end of the hotel 2 I asked for a queen size bed but was given two single beds put together the bed was comfortable until you fall through the middle which I did and sprained my ankle in the process Especially annoying due the the fact I called the lobby when I entered my room just to express my concern yet they said they think I will enjoy it 3 The shower was very small hardly enough space to turn without hitting your elbow on the glass door or wall 4 Elevator broke but wasn t confirmed fixed before letting the public us it I got stuck on the 4th floor which is weird cause another guy got off at the 2nd floor The elevator was out of service for a couple of days but when it was supposed to be fixed I got trapped inside Luckily it still moved when I pressed the 5th floor button and got out walked the stairway down after that </br><hr>Nationality

first floor and they had a disco going on loudly until past midnight apparently that happens very often The room also faces the main road where a tram passes by every 5 minutes and that is like an earthquake throughout the night impossible to get any sleep and very stressful They arranged for me to move to a room higher up on the 4th floor and facing the back the following night so it was ok Wifi is poor There is no password and it resets every 24 hours or so so if your phone is on roaming and the internet resets in the meantime you are in trouble Also the network disappears quite frequently Room service is very poor the menu in the room has old prices and when they give the receipt it has a higher price in it They also charge you an additional 8 on top of the prices quoted in

the 5th floor of a building The staff were quick to put me into a different room and offered to help with the relocation The internet kept dropping out which is rather irritating The breakfast is poor for this class of hotel I checked it out and decided not to bother Finally the lobby music is far too loud and very obtrusive I could hardly hear the staff on check in and also I decided not to eat in the hotel restaurant because of the loud music </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Arab Emirates </br></br>Positive:  New Hotel good location and front staff super helpful and friendly Close to

nicely decorated and helpful staff</br></br>Negative: Breakfast this was disappointing they have juices made from concentrate and if you want to have a fresh juice you have to pay extra same thing for the warm choices you had only scrambled eggs which were not edible really poor quality and if you wanted omelette or poached eggs you had to pay extra This is not good and probably the reason why I will not go back it is like to say i give you cheap things unless you pay extra but in order to sell the room in an easier way I advertise room with breakfast included A suggestion sell the room for 10 euros more but don t do this trick because it looks bad and even other clients around me complained about it </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  I have never stayed in a hotel that is as perfectly located as the Hotel Straf It is a 60 second walk away from the Duomo and main shopping district so easy to pop back to the hotel to put your bags down or charge your phone It also is positioned down a quiet side road so the entrance does not have any cars or a lot of tourists outside I think the room was a perfect size and not too small at all as some of these reviews say I loved the bathroom area and look of the room Is really dark and I m normally someone who prefers everything to be light but I feel the darkness really aided my sleep and I felt very well rested when leaving Milan Staff were really friendly and helpful When I had an issue gaining access into my room cleaner on that floor at the time helped Waiter in breakfast room was very pleasant and accommodating as were the waiters in the bar I had forgotten a European adaptor toothbrush and umbrella all of which they let me borrow free of charge When I checked in females on the desk could have been better and a bit speedier but male on desk at check out was excellent This is when I asked where I could purchase an umbrella as it was torrential rain outside and he gave me one Really great customer service Would return and recommend to colleagues </br></br>Negative: Reception desk could do with being bigger There was only 2 people ahead of me when I was checking in but took at least 15 minutes before I was seen I wish at check in they explained how to get in to your room as upon first arriving as the hallways are quite dark and there is no door handle it took until the cleaner came and helped me that I actually got in The bed was on wheels and as the floor was not carpet the bed moved every time you got in to it or just generally moved in it Other than that it was comfortable All in all a lovely stay and would definitely return </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  South Korea </br></br>Positive:  Good location for experience of central Milano Modern and stylish metal interior of guestroom Somebody wouldn t like the design but attractive for me Nice breakfast with fresh bakery </br></br>Negative: Hard to get a sleep because of loud music and noisy guests from

night </br></br>Negative: The d cor took a little getting used It was very unique having concrete floors and barely any furniture After a couple of nights it was fine </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Australia </br></br>Positive:  the size of the room was great and the location was quite good in that it was central to where i needed to go</br></br>Negative: It was noisy especially having a room above the bar and being woken up early every morning by garbage collection trucks The continental breakfast was average and measly for the included breakfast deal the added breakfast prices were exorbitant 17 euro for a boiled egg really and that didn t include toast Surely some fresh fruit and yogurt could be part of the continental breakfast Each time I ordered room service the coffee was cold even though I asked for it to be extra hot The room service meals and menu left alot to be desired very unexpected in Italy I could not believe they would have frozen lasagne on the menu The wifi connection was very slow and kept dropping out so it was extremely difficult to do any work I was charged 20 euro to iron a couple of garments as I was told that it was too dangerous to supply an iron to the room when the website stated that it had an iron and ironing board available The room was very dark being all black and for a so called eco hotel I was surprised at the number of lights and light switches that were in each room and being so dark the lights needed to be left on during the day The double bed consisted of two single beds pushed together one being a different height to the other very annoying in the middle of the night when you roll over One side of the bed was very comfortable though The hairdryer in the bathroom was useless I had to actually book into a salon to have my hair washed and dried There was no shampoo or conditioner either and the products supplied were very drying on the skin All in all I was very much looking forward to my stay and was bitterly disappointed </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Location is fantastic Public areas are trendy and up to date</br></br>Negative: Room was really tired looking The

couldn t see to put on makeup the only other mirrors was on the back of the front door and also dimly lit this was very frustrating The shower flooded all the way through to the bedroom on the first day but to their credit the hotel resolved this matter very quickly The air conditioning drove me insane even when switched off it made the worst throbbing noise which actually woke me up one night and it was torture The only way to stop the noise was to turn the AC on to the highest fan level so I could fall back asleep but in the freezing cold Finally the hotel is a 10 minute walk from Porta

pleasant They charge 7 euros For a bottle of bier I normally don t pay attention to the minibar prices but after been charged the same in the bar I had to check Why 7 euros for a bottle This is Italy

bunk bed There is no complimentary water bottles provided No coffee maker in the room The Hair dryer in the bathroom is 10 years old and with old technology hence doesn t serve the purpose While I was

hotel is to provide a quiet environment for a good nights sleep Unfortunately i was in a room on the 4th floor facing the main road The noise from the street was intrusive So much that i thought the windows were open I could hear peoples conversations outside They should invest in soundproofing their windows Also as a business traveler i travel light and need to refresh a shirt and suit trousers They do not have an iron and ironing board in the room or available at reception They charge for ironing services which for an overnight stay is asking too much since the turnaround time ie i need to refresh my shirt in the morning before breakfast but they can not provide the service to do this </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United States of America </br></br>Positive:  Location vis a vis my

hotel offers decent Valle when compared to other hotels in the area </br></br>Negative: The TV and cable set up recently changed and did not work very well The wifi was not as effective as it once was

not even bother to respond to me in English he kept talking in Italian like he wanted to make a point The room was the size of a closet true I booked a room for a single person but still I am amazed they call that a room I went for a conference with Bocconi and I had to leave one night early Of course they did not want to cancel the last evening although I stayed there already two nights Because it was an emergency everything happened too fast on my side and I could not call bookings during that time period to report the issue So they just charged me without any shame The younger nice guy at the checkout told me that the management may respond if I threat them with my Bocconi ties But why should one do that and not expect fair treatment Other than that I ve seen better rooms in the hotel

and sausages You need trays of hot water or heated plates underneath the food Staff A blonde lady with short cropped hair told us when we first arrived that there was nowhere to eat close to the hotel apart from McDonalds Turn right out of the hotel and follow road down to pedestrian bridge a 10 min walk to find cafes bars and a Carrefour Express in Comasina which is the closest Metro stop

the art around the hotel </br></br>Negative: The two buildings ether side of the hotel were having work done to them so didn t look great but there was no noise from these works when i was there </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  The breakfast was quite reasonable There was apparent shortage of staff because it took a long time to have the plates cleared People had to que for a seat while holding food The problem was the management not staff How can you expect two staff to serve 100 guests within half an hour </br></br>Negative: The bar area was trendy plastic chairs in Leonardo da Vinci hotel was out of place The area does not give you the impression of four star but a budget hotel Transport facility was incredibly bad for an overseas guest There should be a minibus between the Metro Comasina and the hotel at frequent intervals say half 0ne hour For that reason I would not recommend for anyone of my age There was no business facility I would not stay there on future business trips </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Netherlands </br></br>Positive:  good value for money close to the highway only 35 min drive with a car to bergamo

</br></br>Positive:  The rooms were super spacious and clean the best aspect of the hotel The bathroom was really nice The rooms facing the entrance door had a nice view Breakfast was nice Wifi was really good I didn t have any problems with it </br></br>Negative: The location can be irritating It was a 12 to 15 minutes walk from Comasina metro station You may be irritated by noise of other neighbors at night Also the lighting of the rooms can be improved And about the receptionists although some of them were kind and friendly others were not as kind and helpful maybe because they were busy and tired </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  France </br></br>Positive:  very good ratio price service</br></br>Negative: Parking address is not given on website for GPS no sign on the street when you turn into the one way road of the hotel that you are wrong when you arrive at gate entrance you learn that you have to drive 1 extra km to drive around buildings and go to official parking lot which is on the side Even after 2nd visit I missed it again Very frustrating </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Denmark </br></br>Positive:  Big spacious rooms free parking </br></br>Negative: The

when I moved in after a bad experience in another one in the same town The Da Vinci hotel surprised positively me with a very cosy but large room Big and nice bathroom Very good breakfast Nice bar Very confortable bed Very big and free parking Excellent ratio quality price </br></br>Negative: To be honest the only weak point that didn t affect me in this occasion of this hotel is that you need to have a car due to the location quite far from the Milan downtown The rest is perfect And on the opposite if you have a car this is the perfect location to park the car for free in a very large parking </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Turkey </br></br>Positive:  At least the rooms are big cozy and they seem clean However this was last of my concerns </br></br>Negative: No fitness no spa Compared to a BnB hotel the breakfast is good but compared to a 3 star average otel it is normal breakfast nothing continental or great about it Rooms are not soundproofed I can hear average to loud talking from both walls of my room Although I hanged the do not disturb sign on my door my room was entered and cleaned After warning the reception about this and having them take a note and promise that it will not happen again IT DID HAPPEN AGAIN THE NEXT DAY My room was again entered and made up What kind of approach to privacy and customer request is this What is the problem I will talk to the manager on my checkout if this time what they said is true Not recommending this hotel to anyone Last but not least it specifically states soundproofing on booking com and fitness here on Google but both of them DON T EXIST Breakfast is regular for me not continental as stated on booking WiFi is provided but slow and unstable </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Italy </br></br>Positive:  The

staying in hotel ever Not 4 hotel Staff is very rude The receptionist gave me the right room only form third time With the rude reply that he don t see the point in my complains The area is very bad Metro is 20 min by walking No shops no ATM Nothing there Very hard to find a hotel There are no signs on the street In the rooms there are no kettle So you are not able to enjoy tea or coffee in your room only buy in the bar The bath tap was broken So it took ages to fill the bath Instead of duvet cover they give just a sheet I know it is Italian way but in my opinion it is not hygienic In the check in you must give 100 euro deposit And city tax is 5 euro per night But all this is nothing in comparison with crowing roosters outside It was not possible to sleep It is insane to have this animals in hotel territory I could not believe it was happening The hotel was noisy by itself Bad noise isolation Do not recommend It could be a good hotel probably with another management </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Switzerland </br></br>Positive:  Great eclectic collection of artwork in curious styles Good feel </br></br>Negative: Not what I would call 4 star Very noisy room It

had a good start with an upgrade The room had a plumbing issue that led to bad smell in the room The quality is not the best but it is new Staff have an opportunity to improve how to deal with requests I asked if I could extend the stay for another night and were told the hotel were complete Then a few notes and low voices passed between the lady behind the counter and I presume her boss and she came back with Yes you can stay for 800 euros per night I think there normal rates are 90 euro to 120 euros so a HUGE increase for an average hotel They would have been better off saying there were no rooms rather than insult me or as they say in Italy Preso per il culo Its a no show next time </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United States of America </br></br>Positive:  Quiet Clean staff we super nice Did not have lunch or dinner breakfast was decent and breakfast staff also were very nice </br></br>Negative: Smoke from smokers below my room outside I had room above the smoking area

or iron available No table in room to do any writing and work on laptop Room was covered in dust and wasn t cleaned in 4 days except the bed was turned daily Laminate floor was poorly layed down Requested quite room but it was like being next to a farm Every hour a cockerel would start crowing The lift created so much noise it would wake me up during the night Other hotel guests passing in the hallway would also wake me up The list goes on </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Turkey </br></br>Positive:  Large rooms but spartan and not soundproof Good beds good bathtub but unfinished

it just upon we left hotel So almost everybody brings their suitcases down the stairs There is no line for suitcases </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Romania </br></br>Positive:  The breakfast was pretty good The rooms were pretty </br></br>Negative: The hotel is 15 minute walking distance from a metro station which will seem far after a day of visiting when you are exhausted The area is far away from the city so if you want to get something to eat at night good luck You will not feel you are in Milan but somewhere near Milan from where you commute daily The rooms were very NOISY The windows were very badly soundproof so it was the same if they were open or closed Same for the entrance door I always heard everything that happened on the hallway loud and clear Plus my room was next to the elevator Great The thing that bothered me the most is that they blocked 200 euros from my card when I got there and now two days after I got back the money is still blocked Unacceptable Another horrible thing was the temperature it was very cold and the heating didn t work The temperature we set on the thermostat made no difference on the actual room temperature We kind of froze a little Thank God it was spring Also I don t get it how they are rated 4 stars They have no facilities at all no pool gym etc I would not stay here again nor recommend anyone to do so People if you want to get a real feel of Milan stay at the hotel in the city not in the countryside You ll want to get a shower after a day of walking around and then go get dinner Better take a three star hotel in the heart of the city if you re budget conscientious than daVinci You ll spend more money on night taxis otherwise anyway </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Kuwait </br></br>Positive:  staff and room

will here focus on what has happened since last time Reception staff is more friendly and the security guard mentioned earlier has been replaced with a more friendly looking man The hotel uses now a couple of security men but why In the restaurant at breakfast time one was standing looking at all guests enjoying their breakfast A little difficult with security men looking at you Never seen that before at other hotels Good breakfast and kind and friendly waiters I had only one night to stay but I had some preferences about room and floor I had in advance told the hotel about it but I had to say it again when I arrived I came at a little bad time because a guest who was leaving the hotel was very angry and let all hear about it The receptionist told me it was of course not normal and excused the scene I agree if a guest has a problem tell the reception staff about it and get a solution I got what I had asked for when telling about my preferences The rooms are very nice and I really like the design of light in the rooms However be aware about if it works or not In my room several spot s were gone Being there only one night I would not make anything about it just telling the staff in the morning they had to be changed It is good that it is now possible to get something to drink in the bar until midnight That was not possible before However this is a four star hotel and If you have a bar why not sell the most common drinks and have some good wines to It could be much better My conclusion is however If you get a good discount you get a very comfy room with a good bed I would like a lounge area very much For the time being the hotel is more like a 3 star hotel </br></br>Negative: Nothing important to say I only stayed for a night </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  South Korea </br></br>Positive:  location and price </br></br>Negative: Staff attitude is annoying especially reception Coming back at night I realized that my room had not been cleaned at all but when I complained at the reception a male staff replied something like I just started my job today so I am sorry but I don t know about this we will check And then he called me soon after to ask if I had accidentally left do not disturb sign on the door Obviously not The day after at checkout I asked to another lady receptionist if they knew about the uncleaned room problem Yes we are aware and we will check with the cleaning lady That s it WOW Now I understand that sometimes accidents can happen and I am not so upset for unclean room but much more for the arrogant and self centred attitude of both receptionists I travel often and it is clear to me that this hotel don t train its staff to be service oriented They actually made me feel like I was bothering them And there was no real apology no nice gesture It s a shame because Arimboldi hotel is otherwise good in a convenient location with excellent price point </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Austria </br></br>Positive:  The room was clean the free wifi really worked and the tv selection was excellent sports channels There was a mini bar in the room with reasonable prices Except checkin checkout i did not have any contact with the staff they were not overly friendly but also not unfriendly </br></br>Negative: The location of the hotel is close to the last stop of the M5 subway it s quite a long ride from the city When i arrived in the middle of the night the area seemed pretty dodgy Groups of young men were hanging out on the streets it was pretty dark so altogether rather unwelcoming the hotel stands next to some dilapidated building and is enclosed by huge blocks of apartment buildings First time inside the bathroom i could not open the plug of the sink When i looked under i saw it had been fixed with some sticky tape I readjusted everything and it worked again but the way it was fixed appeared pretty unprofessional when i missed the last train one night the taxi ride from the city cost 35 </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United States of America </br></br>Positive:  Very modern comfortable and efficient facility excellent breakfast </br></br>Negative: The position is not very convenient and far from the major city s attractions </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Italy </br></br>Positive:  To be honest nothing</br></br>Negative: Not polite contact even arrogant at one point at the phone Poor breakfast for a hotel which is claiming himself as 4 stars Some dirty in the shower some other dirty and strangely sticky as maybe a old stain of Cola never cleaned on the upper face of the counter where is the frigidaire bar and the safe box However the top was when I discovered the presence of some strange insects on the walls and the following morning another in the bed At that point I moved to another hotel in Milan I just came back in the morning to retrieve a bag that I had forgotten the night before So I got to discover the breakfast a two three stars breakfast level for my criteria Anyway I can t admit this level of issues in a 4 stars </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Poland </br></br>Positive:  Comfortable bed nice and spacious bathroom </br></br>Negative: The smoke alarm installed above the bed caused some disturbance while getting asleep bright light flashing during whole night </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Saudi Arabia </br></br>Positive:  The croissants were OK and the restaurant and front office staff were very helpful</br></br>Negative: The room we were in was too small I couldn t even place my computer onto the small table in order to charge it As a result I couldn t do any work in the room </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Turkey </br></br>Positive:  It s one of the hotels nearby the business and academic center in Bicocca neighborhood of Milano For those who goes for long running or long walking even during their travels the hotel is very close to Parco Nord Milano Very close to public transportation a main bus station and metro station Bignami is 2 3 minutes by walking </br></br>Negative: The hotel says that it is a 4 star one However no proper restaurant for dinner And no good breakfast For example especially very poor selection of cheese and dairy products isn t the hotel in Italy No fitness room And finally in the lobby area there were some staff walking idle and chatting around while the receptionists looked they don t like their job without a smile in their face This brings a negative atmosphere in the hotel entrance and shows in my opinion a lack of managerial attention The hotel location and capacity could be served in a much better way by increasing the quality of the restaurant at least the breakfast and by letting some smile and motivation into the staff And a basic and good ventilated fitness room would be a plus nice to have </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Denmark </br></br>Positive:  Breakfast was satisfying </br></br>Negative: The only thing was the hotel security They could smile a bit They acted like that you are entering to a nightclub and make you feel uncomfortable somehow </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Iran </br></br>Positive:  Staff cleanness breakfast quality Metro near hotel Cinema and food court near hotel </br></br>Negative: Breakfast doesn t have any kind of cheese and it was amazing No tea or coffee maker in the room </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Italy </br></br>Positive:  The breakfast was nice location suitable and the discounted price was excellent </br></br>Negative: While comfortable it felt more like a 2 or 3 star hotel It seemed the only coffee available was from the automated machine and the bedside table was dusty The furnishings in the room were very cheap But considering what I paid it was nevertheless an excellent value and I would definitely stay again at the same price I would not stay at the full rate </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Italy </br></br>Positive:  The service was excellent The food was good The price was appropriate </br></br>Negative: There was a spot on the wall in the bathroom The room was clean but it could have been even cleaner </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Belgium </br></br>Positive:  Extremely kind staff Room are new and clean Very quiet place Far from the center but very easily connected by metro which is at only two minutes by foot </br></br>Negative: The air conditioning did not work properly Only worked few hours during the evening During the night and in the morning the room ad bathroom were cold Even if I set the temperature at 30 only cold air came out </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Germany </br></br>Positive:  The room was well cleaned with a decent bed and sanitary equipment Pretty good free WiFi Price worthiness is given </br></br>Negative: The cold ambiance in the lobby as well as the breakfast hall It has the flair of a company cantina most furniture is plastic made and not inviting you to enjoy a restful evening at the bar after a day of working or exploring the city TV in room is integrated an a fancy way behind a mirror but is not great to use especially the channel lineup is very restricted and the reactivity is very bad </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Netherlands </br></br>Positive:  Very friendly staff and very quick follow up by the caretaker </br></br>Negative: Minor adjustments to make it a great hotel The entrance of the building could easily be made more visitor friendly when taxis could drive until in front of the door instead of in front of the fence The quality of the dinner buffet may very well be improved by having a heating system A shower curtain or wall avoiding the bathroom to flood while showering would also be a great improvement </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Belgium </br></br>Positive:  location next to the office very personal I know Lovely rooms great interior design good value for money at 65 euro Early breakfast available free wifi works well </br></br>Negative: Carpet was heavily stained and walls needs paint job because of all the markings Tv is faboulously hidden behind the mirror but that makes it difficult almost impossible to control Breakfast was varied and plenty but of low quality yellow rubber instead of real eggs bad coffee in Italy but lots of different cakes available Bar has very white bright neonlight which makes it not a place you want to be in the evening </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Estonia </br></br>Positive:  Clean room helpful staff good room </br></br>Negative: Breakfast is rather poor for 4 stars selection of hot food is very moderate but this is common for Italy No apple juice </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Norway </br></br>Positive:  Modern hotel with comfortable room </br></br>Negative: The hotel is very convenient for Milano Bicocca University but it is out of the city center It is very easy to get to more touristic areas but it takes 20 30 minutes with public transportation The area is not very attractive in the evening Hotels in Milano are expensive still the price tag of this hotel was too high but considerably cheaper than similar alternatives in the city center </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Italy </br></br>Positive:  Great pricing in a period where the frenzy for the Expo closure has led hotel rates in Milan to unsustainable levels</br></br>Negative: The hotel website boasts a restaurant with an enticing menu including fillet steak with rosemary potatoes and a wide array of wines Alas in the meanwhile the restaurant had been resized to a gloomy buffet restaurant with cold dishes and an extremely noisy radio playing a football match commentary I asked the bouncer maitre about the fillet and he skeptically answered to me that the restaurant offered only a buffet </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United States of America </br></br>Positive:  The hotel was near the University of Milano Bicocca where I was visiting for a few days and that was very convenient Very good happy hour in the evening Also breakfast was nice </br></br>Negative: The room was very tiny there were no drawers or shelfs to place one s items This was part of an extended stay in Europe and I had more luggage than just for a couple of days so I needed some space to store it Also no hooks for the coats The room was equipped with different lights with no convenient lighting over the working table which was tiny and in a shape of a triangle not enough space for a computer and a notebook There were only two outlets in the room My daughter was with me so we had trouble charging our computers and phones at the same time </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Very clean modern hotel excellent staff </br></br>Negative: Modern Sky TV didn t work properly so I reported it Next day I arrived back and it was working then stopped once I started changing channels Third day they came and re booted it and after 5 minutes it stopped again </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Italy </br></br>Positive:  Everything looks new and of good quality furniture tv etc Room quite comfortable in almost everything</br></br>Negative: Some programs of sky tv were not included in the room rate and the breakfast was quite modest the breakfast room was almost a mess and the personnel was not taking care of details cups glasses and dishes were missing coffee machines were out of order etc The receptionists were in trouble managing for customer checkout and a huge queue was there in from of the desk Poor organization and professional standard not suitable to match the expectations for a 4star hotel in Milan</br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Belgium </br></br>Positive:  Excellent Price offer ratio despite the Fashion week event </br></br>Negative: Personally everything was OK but my colleague had a room at 26 C without possibility to fix the air conditioning issue except by opening the window of the noisy street </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  The hotel is new the staff relatively friendly the wifi works well and the design is very modern </br></br>Negative: The hotel charges 5 Euros per day extra than the booking price for local municipal taxation This should appear on the calculation of the daily price as it is unfair competition to other hotels The hotel and booking site mentions there is a shuttle service to the airport available for a price Upon questioning it turned out that by shuttle service they meant an expensive bus from the Central Train Station This is a joke as one can get a cheaper train from the station and it is by no means a shuttle service It should not appear at the website as such otherwise it is misinformation Finally the hotel location is not ideal with street workers stopping cars for business just outside late at night and the hotel staff not really bothered with it </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Sweden </br></br>Positive:  Great service from the staff Came before check in time but that was not a problem they could provide me with a room Very helpful in getting me a taxi to Linate Airport Nice breakfast with lots to choose from Very close to the subway 5 min </br></br>Negative: A bit far from everything that is Milano the city center with the Duomo The surrounding areas looked like an old industry area Would have been nice with training facilities and maybe a pool in the future </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Italy </br></br>Positive:  Staff at the lobby</br></br>Negative: Cleaning
