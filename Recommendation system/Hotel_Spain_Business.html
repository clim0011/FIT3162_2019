walk from Placa Catalunya Enthusiastic amicable staff Very quiet room </br></br>Negative: The hotel is sadly let down by bad housekeeping For example the hand soap was not replaced the floor towel for the bathroom was also not replaced a couple of times and no replacement bag in the bathroom bin one day The complimentary water also was not replaced after I drank it on the first night just an empty bottle left and the cups I used for tea were left at the mini bar dirty The safe also had problems on the last night I m 100 sure I had the code right although one of the guys at the reception came and sorted this out immediately but said there might have been some problem with the circuit The air con would just not get the temperature right and if I didn t open the window during the night the room could get stuffy and dusty Also the woollen bed cover had seen better days Finally I doubt the floor was ever mopped the same long hairs were on the floor throughout my stay As I said in my

facing the walkway So no natural air nor outside view No seating nor desk nor cupboard in the room but coffee bar substituted for the former Asked for a second blanket as reliance on air conditioning

asked me to move them to another hotel as there were all kinds of small but inconvenient issues the air con appeared to be working but the room was not getting any cooler shower had low pressure the room seemed a bit outdated breakfast wasn t nice etc I had two rooms booked for 4 days one of them a suite I asked the hotel to cancel the other 3 nights and keep one night as cancelation fee that s the policy if you cancel less than 24 hours before the stay and on booking com it appeared that it can be cancelld anytime if you pay one night Print screen attached They refused saying we can check out but pay the remaining 3 nights for each of the rooms I sent emails to Booking com with print screen of the reservation that seems to show this cancelation policy they did not have ANY answer They just encouraged me to take photos of the room so we can convince the hotel that the room is inappropiate I can t really take photos of shower pressure and temperature My boss who was actually staying at the hotel had business meetings all day and didn t want to interact with them so he asked me his PA to negotiate with the hotel I made the booking from my account I handle all his travelling arrangements especially abroad outside Japan The hotel refused the request because the person actually staying in the room did not report directly despite telling them many times through the Booking

very much and would most probably come back soon there are still a few things that could be improved For example the WiFi is for free but the network quality in the room was very very poor And as the

the world a favour also noticed clients that spoke English at first were treated much better I have read reviews from non european travellers about a similar rude attitude so this might indeed have something to do with the grudging service as my appearance would fit that assumption I left tips for the cleaning staff every single day yet still they left dirty glasses on occasion and would not replace a towel even though the hotel policy said if its left in the tub it will be replaced This happened four days in a row On occasion I had to mention it twice On the last day it seemed as a sarcastic way they filled the room with more towels the needed When I reported a broken bin in the morning the receptionist said she would look into it and get it fixed When I came home later in the evening it was left as it was I reported it again to reception the lady on duty Cludia was flippant someone came up to have a look then said you don t really need it replaced but after further stress said he would see that is was sorted later that evening Nothing happened phoned booking at ten and suddenly the hotel started to treat me like a valued customer but of course being as it was this hotel that too failed within minutes when a rude night porter came up and ordered me to pick up the old one and give it to him like I was his slave no manners no grace no apology even for the delay

exploring the city very easy for my husband and son who had accompanied me on the trip The natural history museum which was just next to the conference centre and the beach a little beyond the centre were also firm favourites with them There was a shopping mall with eateries and popular brands within walking distance too During their walkabouts my husband and son discovered several halal eateries

storms so I arrived at 22 30 My Checkin was an absolute disaster the Reloje suite that I had booked and was confirmed to me via booking s reservation confirmation was given to an other client who had reserved a family suite that was give to me afterwards Since the people did not like their family room the front desk manager Lucy at reception took on her to give my room away all though confirmed to me to an other guest I had specially booked the Reloje suite because I needed to have a table for 6 for meetings since I had interviews and meetings on top of that I travel with a lot of it for work so I need space When I arrived for check in at 22 30 the receptionist Tatiana checked me in seemed trobled when asked her if there was a problem she said management had decided not to give me the suite When I insited arguing I had a confirmed suite they said air conditioning was not working then it was under construction Oh I said so if it is under constriction no one is staying in the room so I would like to see it That was impossible and refused They tried to lie there way out of it This is unacceptable Lucy did not care since she knew I had no other alternatives This caused delays agravation and a lot trouble for my meetings This is not acceptable The next day I complained to senior management and two hours later they gave me a tower suite and I did not have to pay for the first night I did appreciate the management s gesture but did not compensate for the trouble and time I lost I am still waiting for a formal excuse letter that I have not received until now I will
