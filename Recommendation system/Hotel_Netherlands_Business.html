windows that open fully I had a sunny courtyard room no view but very pleasant vintage Scandinavian reading chair that could not have been more comfortable good pillows good bed They took a smallish room and made it really comfortable efficient and stylish in a kind of retro mid century way It felt more like a good guest room at a friend s house than a hotel room Will never be confused with a

kitchenette in them aiming at long stay visitors Wifi was excellent </br></br>Negative: The location was not as convenient as I thought about a 5 minute walk from the tram stop line 5 but not as close

</br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United States of America </br></br>Positive:  Very convenient location for my purposes Close to the world Trade Center close to the railroad station to the airport

and good breakfast cereals granola muesli milk coffee tea juices marmalade bread butter cheese ham yoghurt fruit boiled eggs pastries Tram metro stop number 5 51 to Central Station Amsterdam within 10 minutes walking There are also buses within 2 minutes walking which go to the city centre </br></br>Negative: No plastic bags for the bins livingroom kitchen and bathroom which I think it s essential

perfect </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Ireland </br></br>Positive:  I love the shopping center it s attached to with some great shops and restaurants Also I love the decor of the hotel

Located right next to a nice shopping mall which has supermarkets some shops and restaurants the Vietnamese place is quite good </br></br>Negative: I was here attending a conference at the nearby university which is 15 mins walk away The city however is far from the hotel and if I were a tourist I would find it too far at least 45mins tram ride plus walk The city itself is beautiful and is nothing like where the hotel is located It s safe and clean but nothing much to look at I was also quite disappointed by the staff The man I checked in with could have been friendlier When checking out I asked for a taxi at 3pm When it didn t show up after 3 I asked and was told I should wait a bit more At 3 09 I asked again I was pacing in front of them and they never came to ask They made a call and I was told the taxi was stuck in traffic and should arrive in 5 mins The taxi didn t arrive till 3 22 and I was getting very nervous I spoke with the driver and I believed that the company

a good living room area Location just above a AH XL supermarket within a huge shopping mall Relax weekday offer of free drinks is a great idea </br></br>Negative: Size of the studio is smaller than

was lucky to get a bike so I really enjoyed my last day One of the guys at the reception was very responsive and polite I wish I knew his name to give him my 10 points which I cannot give to another guy that didn t know when is the check out time and a lady that was smiling when I told her I will write review for not cleaning my room at all </br></br>Negative: The hotel is new and the first impression is Wow However when I went for breakfast in the morning I was surprised to see that there was nothing to eat but bread 3rd grade cheese kind of ham and green melon Next surprise came when I returned from work at 18 30h and found out that nobody cleaned my room Well I had to be very noisy at the reception to get my room s towels changed and litter bin replaced I wish they cleaned the the floor too Vacuum cleaning technology hasn t come to this hotel yet Mop is a dirty job for a room keeper so forget it Many people commented here that the hotel has good location Maybe if you go to Amsterdam for shopping in a small mall with 10 shops or to buy cheap beer from the supermarket The reality is that the nearest metro station is 15min away fast walking and another 25 minutes ride in the train to reach the center of the city In fact I was much faster with the bike I was lucky to get from the lobby as there are only two bikes for all guests </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:

directly with them </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  All brand new rooms are big their studios are good value for money connected to the mall and you have a lot of

had a breakfast box prepared the first morning when I had to leave at 6 40 for a train to get to my work destination The quality of the packed breakfast was quite poor compared to what was offered at the breakfast buffet They didn t give much chance for choosing on the form that I filled out I suggest improving that form Also the loud music in the lobby at most hours is kind of annoying But I am 58 years old and its clear this is a hotel geared towards younger clientele so I guess that it doesn t bother them Also I could not hear it from my room The insulation was good The lighting in the room was very very dim even with every single light possible fully lit The hotel is in a nice corner on the Ij but is at best a 13 minute walk to any sort of public transportation People should be aware </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Loved style of hotel decoration friendliness of staff</br></br>Negative: toiletries were really difficult to open seems

Perhaps include pork sausages at breakfast for the real breakfast experience </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Modern and generally clean </br></br>Negative: Left room at 9am having left a sign on the door to say I was out and room ready for service Returned at 4 30pm and my room had still not be serviced Inexcusable when one is paying 180 a night Also hotel is not in the heart of Amsterdam as stated but is ten minutes walk from central station and at least 15 minutes brisk walk to Dam Square Also no bars or restaurants to speak of with half a mile of hotel

overpriced and buffet understocked </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  France </br></br>Positive:  The Central train station is within walking distance </br></br>Negative: From personal experience I certainly would not recommand that hotel which looks and feels more like a train station hall than a place you could call home for a few days Answering to an offer sent by mail I chose to pay to get upgraded when elsewhere this is usually offered on arrival only to be proposed once arrived to pay again for an other better upgrade The room was nice enough facing not the sea nor the city but the industrial zone of A dam why should we pay for that view I wondered Long queues are to be expected on checking in or out at any time clueless smileless trainees requiring that you fill up new forms distributed at random what s the use of Booking com then some justification being that the system doesn t work In this dark and inhospitable place where breakfast cost 20 euros room service is very invasive someone from room service stepped in my room early one morning without being invited that s a first And every morning up to three cleaning trolleys were parked in the corridor leading to my room and were still there by the middle of the afternoon All in all hospitality standards seem quite low at the Aitana and I definitely won t be a roomate again </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Staff are really helpful and friendly The rooms are modern and clean and place has some nice design touches The resturant is worth a visit</br></br>Negative: Location is a bit compromised but that s rejected in the good value in pricing and a short taxi ride or 15 min walk into town isn t too much of problem</br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom

charged the wrong city tax on checkout No bathrobes or slippers I had to go back to reception to request these which was honoured Seating in room 344 was not so good due to the layout of the room which is like a triangle and bed occupies most of the middle of the room </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Netherlands </br></br>Positive:  Everything was good All details are very well thought of Great view from the window And good sound isolation which is rare almost anywhere in Europe </br></br>Negative: The room is not bright enough even with all lights turned on especially when working at

Booking com informed me about absence of parking places in public parking garage nearby only when it was already not possible to cancel reservation 24 hours Even more disappointing was the fact that personnel in the garage explained me that Aitana management didn t reserve parking places for its visitors upfront even thou parking offered to do it This is for me sign of lack of customer care Second disappointment is beautiful view of Amsterdam Even from top 12th flor all you will see is gray block of buildings other side of the street train line and some other elements of city landscape

individual attention Beakfast was perfectly acceptable although quite expensive Because of eggs etc cooked individually which itself was excellent one did have to allow additional time when on a tight business schedule Also Found a very good cafe opposite at which I received equally good attention I will certainly go back to that hotel if I am in Amsterdam again </br></br>Negative: Nothing really The hotel was excellent but in terms of transport it is a bit of a walk to the nearest tram stop but actually it is within reasonable walking distance of the station 25mins once you know where it is When you don t know where it is and neither does the taxi driver then it costs 20 Euros from the station as some of the short cuts are pedestrian only after 8pm </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:

car to wait Coming to the hotel at 11am on Saturday I could not get any cleaning service for one shirt until Monday evening Hotel staff was useless in arranging this outside of the hotel Promised to help and forgot about this Needed to do all by myself find I am not local at all go order and collect Ceilings in the rooms are really low and most of the rooms are looking to the inside building walls and windows To have a street view and not to look into other rooms windows which are 2m away from your own window you need to pay a fortune You can hear all what is happening in the next room or

ready and the staff was surprised and I didn t hear even sorry from one guy who claimed to be the manager I arrived on Nov 15th 7 00 AM</br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  very cool hotel great rooms with everything you could expect even have your own coffee machine service is very professional </br></br>Negative: valet parking quite expensive location is convenient but its a busy part of town next to main train station </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Staff were amazing really helpful very friendly the whole hotel is very nice indeed great ambience great breakfast great facilities</br></br>Negative: The only things I could mention as a negative were the price it s not a cheap hotel to stay in by any means and the bed laying on it initially it felt super comfy but after a night I felt like I was not fully rested There could be two reasons for this A The most expensive single item of furniture in my home was the bed and it s soooo comfortable that it might be tricky for other beds to compete B It appears the beds had a topper on and although it has to be noted it s a very high quality topper I think after 7 8 hours maybe the thickness was just not up to the job Saying this I would say that maybe I am very particular with my comfort in bed and most people may find everything completely ok </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Belgium </br></br>Positive:  Buffet breakfast was just right not too much food but everything was fresh Also liked the fact that the warm breakfast was cooked to order and was excellent Food was also very tasty and fresh had dinner and room service David at the front desk went out of his way to get me an English newspaper from their sister hotel next door I thought that was service the way it ought to be going the extra mile </br></br>Negative: Had room service twice and they forgot the bread basket both times Minor matter though Gym and health facilities are shared with their partner hotel next door which is probably why it seemed a bit crowded </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United States of America </br></br>Positive:  The location of the property is good and the pieces of art that are on display and the overall d cor are tasteful and modern </br></br>Negative: The staff need serious training Frankly they are young and need to understand the basic principles and application of hospitality management The check in process was not efficient And at the check out despite the fact that I provided my email address when I made the reservation online to which I received a reply from the property and when I checked in the hotel did not have my email address correct when I checked out Also I requested to receive a copy of the hotel bill via email and had to request it from the property the following day In addition the staff interface at breakfast was frustrating I had to wait several minutes to be seated despite the fact that there were numerous tables that were unoccupied And then the service associated with ordering hot dishes and beverages at what is billed a buffet is overly controlled and slow </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Interior design of the place art around the hotel and the gallery The staff is very professional especially in the restaurant and at the bar Great food The whole atmosphere is a bit different in this hotel It is very funky and stylish </br></br>Negative: It is a bit dark in the rooms but the interior is interesting anyway </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Japan </br></br>Positive:  Amazing locations incredibly service oriented staff and wonderful facilities Oh and perhaps the best hotel wifi </br></br>Negative: The

poached eggs on brown bread but I got poached eggs that were not cooked and on white bread just a note to the chef to be a little more careful but the staff were great in the restaurant and so it didn t deter from my enjoyment</br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Very well designed restaurant area Rooms were relaxing comfy bed great nights sleep</br></br>Negative: Breakfast was out of sausages and also got our orders wrong</br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  staff very helpful and friendly cool vibe art</br></br>Negative: no 24

trendy upbeat vibe that was consistent throughout the property </br></br>Negative: The bathroom tub was designed by monkeys It had no shower curtain and the glass separator only extended out 2 or 3 feet from the shower head So what ended up happening each night was that a bunch of water would just splash out of the tub and onto the floor I got tired of moping up my mess every night and just ended up letting it evaporate off the floor But still it sucked </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Brazil </br></br>Positive:  The wireless is fantastic The laundry is very good for self service but

check for other possibilities </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Lovely boutique style room Nice alternative atmosphere funky and modern Didn t feel like a student

with a lovely en suite It may sound a bit odd but I loved the bathroom Good size and great shower I had a standard single room The bed was wider than a standard single and the room was a good size for one person Everywhere is very accessible in the building and the metro station is directly outside of the main entrance There are a couple of takeaways close by and also an Albert Heijn supermarket across the road for snacks drinks etc </br></br>Negative: My negative about the room was that there was no no tea and coffee making facilities I thought you would have access to a kitchen which is not

took up a lot of room I ve marked down for breakfast as it s ready made so if like me you have any allergies I m gluten free there is nothing you can eat If though you are a standard eater it looked great and good value for money The vending machines are expensive nearly 3 euros for a bottle of coke</br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  I loved the clean modern

friends </br></br>Negative: I have expected to have free slippers and bathrobe My first room had windows which couldn t be opened so I received an other room The offer for the breakfast is the same every day OK for few days but not for a week or more Good food in the restaurant but no diverse for lunch and dinner The receptionist didn t inform me about using the card room in the lift and I spent 5 minutes going up and down till somebody finally helped me to proceed properly </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  The staff at the hotel were excellent Cannot say

is not professional I opted for the spoil me package that was a huge dissapointment They state daily fruit and snacks while I actually got just a banana and 2 2x2cm brownies the first day and nothing the second The package also was supposed to include the late check out by 15h My card got blocked before 15 and I had to revisit the reception to get it working again This was not a problem for me but really shows that they are not in sync and have no idea who paid for the pavkage and who hasn t I had received the mineral water and shampoos only the first day and had to call the reception and ask for additional ones Even though the package said DAILY mineral water and toiletteries Then at about 14 15 even though i had the do not disturb sign on my door was in fact disturbed by the employee at the reception who said to me and I quote You know you have to check out I replied yes by 15 00 to what she said By 15 00 Okay No apologies nothing Not really on the level of a 4star hotel Finally I requested a company receipt on my email address in english First i got the normal invoice then i got the company one in dutch and had to double check it twice to arrive at the reception one last time and then I was told i cannot get it in english because i had already checked out My company has very strict rules regarding the receipts for the trips I take and without a propper one I would have to cover the expences by myself so this was a problem for me All in all I am very dissapointed by the service I received Would not stay here again not recommended The employees that were not helpful were

return next year However there are things that I wish if you could kindly look into Incident 1 None at the big reception at 8 PM and had to wait 10 minutes for check in The feedback was not received well and I felt like I shouldn t have told him so Remember other hotels have kiosk check in these days The check out was super quick and thank you Incident 2 Requested for a quite room far away from elevators and not near any frequent access areas and what I was allotted initially was a room next to the elevator and also next to a frequent access door which slams on every entry and exit I had to request for an alternate room and the second room was perfect Thanks for the gentleman for sorting it out but he could have read my comments from the online booking request Other hotels do read it out for me at the time of check in and they make sure I get something close to it Incident 3 I felt uninvited when the lady staff at the bar told me that she is unfortunately closed at 10 55 PM I thought the bar was open till 11 PM and all orders are honoured till 11 PM It s great if you could state that the kitchen closing time as a separate one However the gentleman at the reception was very friendly and helped me order a pizza that night Thank you Incident 4 One of the cleaning staff rejected my polite request to change my bed sheet stating that its not listed for change and she showed a lot of aggression when I asked her whom should I contact to get this done We all know when someone is angry However her fellow colleague another lady was kind enough to change the bed sheets and

expect travelling All of that is acceptable for an hostel of high quality not for an hotel of prices as 4stars</br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Spain </br></br>Positive:  The ambient was very modern and friendly and the staff so kind and helpful I would stay again but traveling for business and not for leisure since rooms are fit to solo travelers </br></br>Negative: The space lighting TV and wall 2 wall bed so hi tech but too capsule for a couple that wishes to sit somewhere except their bed It took us some extra time to decode the facilities and equipment using the I Pad The shower knobs need weight lifters to switch them on off The clothing rack not enough for 2 people unless they travel with what they wear and one shirt more The solarium style shower toilet makes the place a bit more noisy than it should be Think the concept is brilliant could work better if the hotel improve the internal facilities and equipment </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Switzerland

</br></br>Positive:  They have the greatest cereal mixes including one for gluten free people AND they have soy milk when you ask for it They have REAL bread that you can slice yourself and REAL jam and berries All the simple good things and something for everyone s taste Surprising how a simple hotel like this can do that whereas the fancy hotels can barely get you a slice of totally tasteless gluten free bread let alone milk powder free and never mind a decent gluten free cereal mix or milk other than cow s Plus one asks for a ristretto the one shot italian one and one actually gets a real one for the other pluses see the section What you didn t like </br></br>Negative: The short story there was literally NOTHING that I did not like The long story Upon arrival in that dark and rather scary entrance I thought Oh my God where the bleeps did I get myself a room this time And then OK ZENNNNNN take a deep breath you ll survive I got a few more moments like that like when getting this flashy youngster guiding me to the computer to check myself in and when arriving in this endless red carpeted hallway with white walls and same colour doors every three meters reminding me of a super funky futuristic version of a psychiatric ward then upon entering my room with flying saucer like coloured lighting over the toilet and shower and this huge TV screen over the bed saying Welcome citizen Martine But every detail I was taken aback by turned out to be actually quite agreeable I even slept like a baby which doesn t happen in many hotels I can tell you that much Waking up with the trees hanging over my window helped And then the cosy every little corner looks different but it all feels like home ground floor where you can chose a different spot every day to have breakfast </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Netherlands </br></br>Positive:  Close to the businesses in Amsterdam Zuid South and still easy to go walk to some good restaurants in the city </br></br>Negative: In the weekend Amsterdam Zuid South is empty as it is a business location in terms of bars and restaurants at the South side </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Singapore </br></br>Positive:  I really enjoyed the hotel I thought that the size of room amenities and breakfast were all ideal for my needs </br></br>Negative: Ideally there could be a gym on site however that wasn t essential given great

</br></br>Positive:  The concept of the hotel is a brilliant one smart rooms easy check in and check out 24h bar </br></br>Negative: I checked in at about 11pm after a long day of traveling and work When I first entered the room I realized it was too cold and switched on the heating At two pm I woke up due to the cold temperature and called reception and asked them to help They said to keep waiting as the temperature could go up I called again 45 minutes later and they offered a blanket and hot tea as the hotel was fully booked and they knew the room was cold I told them that I expected to get a reimbursement as the night I had paid for was a decent night of sleep in a four star hotel and citizen m was not being fair The guy replied that I could get the blanket and tea and he could not do more and said it was unfair that I was asking for a reimbursement to have a free night by justifying it with the fact that heating was not working Horrible </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Poland </br></br>Positive:  Friendly Staff excellent facilities and comforts to enjoy your stay</br></br>Negative: Maybe its just me but to have an extra charge for paying with a credit card is always annoying </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Germany </br></br>Positive:  Very different and modern hotel Gives that Amsterdam feel The lights TV curtains etc can be controlled via iPad which I found very cool There were also Mood lights in the room The bed was nice and comfy The positioning of the shower and toilet in the room is a little weird but the shower was really really good The location is also good There is a tram stop right next to the hotel from where you could reach the city center in 15 20mins The airport is also very easily reachable via train </br></br>Negative: I found the breakfast slightly expensive for the variety available but it was not that bad </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Great stuff nice rooms and set up everything positive about the hotel</br></br>Negative: Only negative point I have is it would be perfect if the room had a small fridge and ironing board</br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Australia </br></br>Positive:  Great place to stay particularly as attending a conference which was within walking distance Super friendly staff super clean and super comfy </br></br>Negative: Nothing was all great </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Sweden </br></br>Positive:  The review score of 6 3 says pleasant Well that s an overstatement if there ever was one </br></br>Negative: Weird self check in system on a first come first serve basis Your room is only designated to you when you arrive So if you re the last one in you re left with what s available This was not said anywhere in hotel s details but a staff member said it when I was checking in The rooms are all the same but the one left for me was first floor next to huge construction site where work started 07 00 Also really price food for sale and quality of breakfast not in line with cost </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Excellent location staff and bar Good common areas for socializing Rooms are quiet TV and room controls are controlled with iPad which is different If you choose not to have your room cleaned you enjoy a 10 Euro credit per night which is very generous </br></br>Negative: The shower and toilet are within the main living space and only separated by sliding glass doors so privacy is at a minimum Limited warm food selections </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Lovely room quiet surroundings Nice breakfast in the morning with excellent coffees Great place to stay if going to RAI for a conference </br></br>Negative: Lack of tea coffee facilities in bedroom </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  </br></br>Positive:  The bed was giant and quite comfortable The room is unique as you can tell from the online photos Very high tech and customizable It was really nice to be able to adjust the lights including with colors and make it comfortable and suitable for work vs relaxing vs waking up I was worried the shower would leak into the room since this is a problem with so many hotel showers and especially since this shower was so different but I am pleased to say it did not leak at all It was a really nice shower and I liked that you had an option to use the handheld shower head OR the rain shower The wifi was fast and easy to connect to The hotel is a short walk from the Amsterdam Zuid station very convenient It is also technically within walking distance of the RAI but the trek is much longer than the 10 minutes the hotel claims it to be especially if you have luggage heavy things to carry or are wearing high heels tip bring comfortable shoes for the walk Amsterdam Zuid Oud Zuid area is not so happening but it s got plenty to offer and is relaxed and much more serene than your typical city center type Amsterdam visit </br></br>Negative: The sheer curtain that you can pull between the bathroom area and the bed should be thicker darker It wouldn t impact the room s open concept feel overall as you can pull it completely out of the way anyway I traveled alone so it was no problem but if I had been with another person a little more privacy and better blocking of light when you re in bed and someone is getting dressed would have been really good Also even when staying alone a thicker curtain option would have better blocked the light coming in from under the room door via the hallway I found the shower to be much more comfortable than I expected however the toilet was much less comfortable than I expected It feels really small once you close the doors The check in process was terrible and apparently doesn t really work for booking com customers this needs to be fixed Breakfast had a lot of options but the eggs were absolutely disgusting </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  The bed was very very comfortable The room was very quiet and the shower was strong enough and the water good and hot Full size bodywash and shampoo provided conditioner provided on request Very modern comfortable feel to the room Gr8 hairdryer </br></br>Negative: The room was cramped and there was no wardrobe only 4 hangers provided for a double room Also a lack of privacy for the toilet and shower No kettle or tea coffee making facilities in the room </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Good common parts to the hotel that make for an engaging experience The rooms are comfortable modern with sizeable bed Hotel is close to Amsterdam Zuid and fairly easy to get to central Amsterdam and Museum district by tram or 15min walk to Museum Square 40 min walk to the centre of the City </br></br>Negative: Not a huge amount of engaging bars or restaurants in the immediate vicinity </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Singapore </br></br>Positive:  Interior design of the room vouchers that can be redeemed to purchase food drinks from the counter if we choose not to clean our room </br></br>Negative: Pillow too soft and hence not enough Complicated shower toilet door and dripping shower head in the middle of the night</br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Saudi Arabia </br></br>Positive:  good location where the WTC is 5 minuts walk and the Zuid train station in which you can reach the airport within 10 minuts Also you can reach the city Center within 20 25 minuts by catching tram 5 which is on the front of the hotel quick check in out very helpful staff</br></br>Negative: the room is a bit tiny no tea coffe maker provided</br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Nice comfortable bed and everything you need I like that you can watch lots of different movies as well although I didn t </br></br>Negative: Check in wasn t that great because the system was down I don t know how often that happens but I had a free beer while I waited so that was ok </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Belgium </br></br>Positive:  Excellent hotel for business or if you are looking for a good level of comfort for reasonable price Very modern and keen on domotica Everything you need to work internet printer common pc s and a large bed to relax The rooms are small rooms but they do not feel small Eye for design AND functionality Everything is done in purpose of function Highly recommendable </br></br>Negative: There are not a lot of restaurants nearby but with tram or else 10 min walk you are in a nice area The room was clean but not spotless that is the only small point where the hotel could improve </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Ireland </br></br>Positive:  Comfortable downstairs common area lovely helpful staff clean </br></br>Negative: The bed wasn t comfortable too hard Also the rooms were pokey and very strange with the toilet open in the middle of the room Food was poor and very overpriced </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United States of America </br></br>Positive:  Good staff easy seamless check in king beds </br></br>Negative: Shower drips it s in the room so it s very loud and wakes you up I ve stayed here 5 times and the shower always drops it wasn t a one off The new citizen m bathrooms at airport much better No hot water shower both mornings </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Czech Republic </br></br>Positive:  Location near Amsterdam Zuid station very friendly staff well designed room excellent shower large comfortable bed reliable wifi for free great movie selection for free good breakfast </br></br>Negative: The toilet in my room kept making noise all the time which made it hard to go to sleep </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Germany </br></br>Positive:  very clean Intelligent smart room design big bed friendly staff cool lobby to hang out and have a drink fast connection to the airport via amsterdam zuid and the trains</br></br>Negative: full airconditioned rooms with no chance to open a window or turn off AC i felt locked in toilet and shower are within the room which might be cool design wise but i hope it is only in single rooms if this would be a shared room with partner or friends it is well akward the tram no5 is in front of the hotel and should offer a direct connection to the amsterdam center but the ride is annoying often delayed overcrowded and it takes half an hour and more No wonder is everyone riding bike</br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Spain </br></br>Positive:  High quality great breakfast Lovely staff Comfortable bed Nice large colorful common spaces Good insulation from noise </br></br>Negative: The room feels a bit claustrophobic without real windows there is a large glass but you cannot open it Also a lot of tech for nothing you have to use a tablet to control everything from temperature to light to TV Finally the shower and the WC in the middle of the room isn t a particularly cool choice It saves space the room is overall quite small but it s ugly and it feels like being inside the bathroom all the time in addition to little privacy when traveling with someone else The first thing you see when getting inside is the wc toilet in the middle of the room if you slalom between them you can find the bed and a closed window covered by layers of automatic blinds </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Customer service is great good location next to the station easy self check in comfy extra large bed </br></br>Negative: Could have used more toiletries toothpaste and a mini bar or at least a tiny fridge for storing drinks snacks </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Spain </br></br>Positive:  Excellent variety of vegan food options and good coffee Super helpful friendly yet non intrusive staff technology in the room worked seamlessly The option to get a 10 eur voucher night if you don t need your room cleaned was great for a business traveller that hardly spends time in the room anyway Quiet I chose a top floor garden view room </br></br>Negative: On the street parking was relatively expensive at 3 eur hour for outskirts of Amsterdam The shower toilet spaces in the room inside retractable glass doors were ok since I was travelling alone but would have been a nightmare otherwise Showerhead kept leaking water randomly throughout the night no matter which way the control was turned </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Poland </br></br>Positive:  Staff was extremely helpful and hospitable Great drinks in the bar free welcoming and farewell drink Breakfast simple but tasty Room controls from Ipad is a great idea </br></br>Negative: Asked for invoice with company details and received it without and needed to ask the hotel to correct it </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Bulgaria </br></br>Positive:  The bed is incredible it s at least 2 by 2 meters and very comfortable The shower is awesome They have improved the breakfast experience a lot you have everything you would expect I like the intelligent room control with an iPad all the settings worked The TV is very large and offers nice channels and movies for free The canteen is pretty cool offers basically everything you would need and a decent coffee not like most hotels The common area is spacious and relaxing The staff is friendly and helpful great people work there The location is very practical you have a train and metro station near by as well as bus and tram stops I would surely recommend this for any business traveler but please keep in mind you need to be a bit twisted to accept all the design decisions </br></br>Negative: Should have been much cleaner Overall I enjoy the interesting design decisions at the hotel but some of them are not practical Especially the sink which makes a mess because it s very small and not practical I would also say invest more in cleaning up before a guest arrives I had paper in the toilet and dust on some places </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Air play facility so you can stream anything from your iphone</br></br>Negative: taps in the shower quite stiff and needed to use some force to turn them on Lights mood useless as only the shower and the toilet can be moody not the rest of the room</br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Location is perfect for the business district and access to transport the hotel runs ever so smoothly access to loads of movies no extra cost is an added bonus if you want to crash and relax </br></br>Negative: No negatives the bathroom capsule type compartments might not be everybody s cup of tea but certainly don t think they are a negative </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United States of America </br></br>Positive:  The hotel is very nice and updated Everything is very tech savvy which I liked The breakfast buffet was amazing Great stay </br></br>Negative: The shower was really hard to figure out It would be helpful if they had temp settings for the water because I took a freezing cold shower more than once because I could not figure out the temp settings and the info pamphlet they give you in the room does not explain how to properly use the shower </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  All good standard CitizenM stuff cool but small room</br></br>Negative: The parking advertised isn t that close and is EUR50 a night Shouldn t really be ticked as included </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  The ipad in the room that allowed me to control everything was just amazing Never had this experience before ever </br></br>Negative: Nothing I didn t really like but the air con in the room was a bit cold as it was winter I would like the 25 degrees to actually feel like 25 degrees </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Staff was friendly and helpful Bed was comfortable</br></br>Negative: I do not like the idea of putting a shower cabin and a toilet unit too close to the bed Because of that the room feels very cramped Too much plastic A bit minimalistic to me</br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Ireland </br></br>Positive:  Amazing bed room controls are very fun</br></br>Negative: Didn t like that the sink wasn t in a pod but in the middle of the room Didn t bother me though </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Netherlands </br></br>Positive:  Very friendly staff pleasant environment good breakfast </br></br>Negative: Small room More space requested for a decent desk and comfortable fauteuil or small sofa to allow a relaxed sit read </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  It was near my office</br></br>Negative: It was a bit too hipster for my liking Having a loo and a shower open 3 feet from where I sleep is not my idea of comfort and that too at a fair cost Breakfast for 13 eur and to get just eggs and bacon is laughable I m not going to be staying at this place again Maybe I m too old for this kind of a hotel </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Russia </br></br>Positive:  Nothing I will never ever stay in this hole again </br></br>Negative: I mean it s OK to turn the TV on from the iPad but I would rather prefer good old fashioned things a glass for water in the room the shower which is easy to deal with please clean my room tag which normal hotels usually have Also the staff was quite rood to me your name is green tea told one of the bartenders when I misheard his question That was rood </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Sweden </br></br>Positive:  the all concept of the chain VITRA furniture in the common areas comfort of the bed movies selection for free very convenient location nearby Amsterdam south train station in front of tramway line 5 to center </br></br>Negative: the high tech installation in the room isn t always easy to understand light blinds </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  A relaxed and informal atmosphere with friendly and helpful staff They served a very good buffet breakfast and dinner if a limited selection I personally prefer that they do a few things well but this may not suit all They also have a well stocked bar The large bed was also very comfortable </br></br>Negative: Lack of ventilation There is no control over the A C and there is no opening window so it can get quite steamy with the open plan shower </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Quick and easy check in</br></br>Negative: First morning the internet failed This led to there being no hot water for showers and having to stumble around to locate the light switch as the Ipad which controlled the lights would not work Due to the internet being down the staff were unable to provide receipts </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Germany </br></br>Positive:  Quick self service check in and check out fast wifi ok bar </br></br>Negative: The hotel is very nice but the rooms are very small and a bit over desgined for my taste almost feels like you re sleeping in the bathroom Office neighborhood but 10 minutes to downtown by car </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  I liked the

considering there is no restaurant Comfortable bed </br></br>Negative: Need to accept their concept of small rooms Not much wardrobe space </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Cool room design Free wifi and movies</br></br>Negative: Hotel didn t take online payment and I was forced to pay via credit card on arrival incurring heafty 3 additional charges from the hotel themselves as well as from my bank Given how small the rooms are albeit well designed the hotel is overpriced </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Netherlands </br></br>Positive:  Value for money is okay</br></br>Negative: They couldn t find the booking Not on the guest name the name of the person who did the booking and also not on the booking number Very confusing for the guest We

rooms look very modern Location is good if you need to be close to the airport or one of the businesses in the area Station Amsterdam Zuid is just a 5 minute walk away </br></br>Negative: Mattress is very thin and hard The shower and toilet in the middle of the room look cool but are quite unpractical Shower was almost impossible to turn on or off and kept dripping throughout the night which made

excellent Shower is good except for the wobbly floor </br></br>Negative: Food very repetitive and limited Room quite claustrophobic Could do with a little more space for hanging clothes

person and the staff are always friendly and accommodating </br></br>Negative: Breakfast is quite expensive Rooms are only really for single occupancy The shower and toilet in the middle of the room

very close to the airport 15 minutes to reach the place Free Internet facilities near reception 4 PCs free printer and password free Wi Fi </br></br>Negative: Breakfast is very modest with very limited options of the food One type of ham 2 types of cheese omlette fried tomatoes and boiled eggs are not fair for the high price of accomodation For the such accomodation price the breakfast should be free of charge included into the price of staying </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Handy location for the conference centre Big comfy beds </br></br>Negative: Laborious self check in process not what you want after a long journey Concierge unable to offer simple services such as airport pick up 15 page required to understand how do basic

close to Schiphol the Amsterdam Zuid train metro station and the VUmc Easy trip to city centre with 5 or 24 bus Very nice public areas on the ground floor </br></br>Negative: Lack of coffee maker in room but there is a nice coffee bar in the hotel If traveling with someone else might have been bothered by the lack of privacy Only serious complaint is the booking process not the fault of CitizenM I thought I had prepaid for the room which was implied by the confirmation email which said that my card could be charged anytime after the booking but it turned out not to be the case so I was unexpectedly stuck with a fee for using a credit card onsite Booking com should do a better job of clarifying when a room is prepaid and when not </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United States of

because two waiters were working the whole restaurant We were told there were supposed to be four wait staff Stopped by the counter to buy a couple bottles of water 3 50 each Rip off The breakfast

wich mad the hotel a little unpersonal </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Belgium </br></br>Positive:  Very confortable bed clean bedroom and spacious enough great hotel facilities Wonderful spa experience and one to come back to again for sure </br></br>Negative: Compulsory flipflops in the spa a tiny statement in the spa brochure goes completely unnoticed you only know it once you are at the spa reception already so make it bigger or more noticeable</br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Hungary </br></br>Positive:  The staff are truly wonderful all the time The hotel is outside the centre but that is clear from the get go and it is very easily reachable by tram 2 in about 20 minutes depending on traffic Breakfast is pretty good with a choice of warm an cold food but for 19 euros they should be offering fish salmon herring the usual marmalade champagne and those other perks of a luxury breakfast Rooms are spacious and clean there is a turndown service as well which is great Reception has a selection of soft drinks fruits and pastries 24 7 with no shops in the vicinity also a good idea </br></br>Negative: I chose this hotel for the gym and the pool The gym is small but adequate The pool which costs an extra 15 euros to begin with though there was a special offer for 10 now and which fact is not mentioned on the website at all is entirely unfit for swimming It is tiny which is something you might expect from a hotel but they are boasting 2000 square meters for the area so instead of a dozen different rooms of saunas and very costly massages it would have been a good idea to start with a somewhat larger pool I have swum in small hotel pools but this one is way too warm therefore there are people sitting in it chatting away using the whirlpool features so there is no room and absolutely no possibility to swim At other times it might be empty so there might be room and no whirlpool features but it would still be way too warm for swimming The hotel should lower the temperature cut the whirlpool features and put up a sign that this is a pool for swimmers or alternately it should describe this as a wellness area rather than a pool I came out of the area after 15 minutes by the way no soap in the showers even though the cleaner had just left explained the above issue there and upstairs at reception No one thought of reimbursing me for a service which I paid for and which they failed to provide With no pool the hotel is too expensive </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  I usually stay at the Hotel Artemis few times a year while staying there I had to stay an extra night but this time they were fully booked so walked over to Corendon its a little more expensive but well worth the extra cost I like the self check in and the front desk staff were brill Will stay here again although the cost could be a lot lower I think for business travellers </br></br>Negative: Bathroom glass door would not stay closed I was not given any cutlery when ordered room service an oversight I guess but very bad for room service Price needs to be more reasonable after all this hotel is in a business district

because we stayed for 9 nights We could have a nice place to sit and relax and at other times enjoy refreshments The hotel location was optimal we arrived at Centraal Station and easily made the walk over to the hotel with our luggage The Sky Lounge has a gorgeous view it is worth going up for a look it does get quite crowded up there Enjoyed food and drink and looking out the window there

excellent </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Central location great view of the city from upper floors</br></br>Negative: Rooms where small and basic TV was a

Sky Lounge at the top great building style on the outside and in the corridors don t let that full you though</br></br>Negative: Wi fi is nearly non existent even though they claim it is free and included really a shame for a modern hotel in the hearth of corporate center such as Amsterdam is Single rooms cheaper version are tiny and consist of 2 separate singly tiny beds for some reason that you believe it or not cannot connect together so you will end up sleeping in a tiny bed realizing there s another one next to eat but due to design fault you can t connect them and create a bigger bed

station although there are hotels closer </br></br>Negative: Awful terrible service I requested to change my booking as I had a change of plan I was travelling for business and not on holiday The staff at front desk took ten minutes to talk to the manager to tell me they couldn t help me I had to contact Booking com I was pressed for time on a short stay When I asked to change the booking I had to rush to a meeting I did have the time to call or e mail Booking com wait for their reply take it back to the reception and again wait for them to process the change in booking This was an absolute farce I had just previously stayed at the Marriott at the city before and they had absolutely no problem accommodating the same request I even stayed with them again after returning from a meeting in another city The front desk staff told me it s not our room anymore we sell it to Booking com They were simply wrong It s their hotel they simply pass on the commission for the stay to Booking com Yet more mis leading information on their Booking com description they advertise as offering Crabtree Evelyn toiletries They most certainly do not Their toiletries are Aroma Actives Essentials by Sysco Guest Supply I use Crabtree Evelyn and it appealed to me when making my booking Sadly Hilton once again disappointed It does not encourage me to stay at any Hilton property again and I don t think I would recommend to my colleagues or business partners either They may not care for the loss of business but I don t think it would be insignificant All I got from the hotel manager was a standard rather insincere apology and an offer of a discount on my next stay However it is not the price or discount that matters to me but the service Service is what matters for business travellers as opposed to leisure travel Sorry Hilton if you got to the end of this rather long review </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Nigeria </br></br>Positive:  location excellent breakfast very

the hotel has no swimming pool and no gym They claim to have one but the gym is located at NH Barbizon Hotel This hotel is 10 minutes walking or 15 minutes if you don t want to walk through the Red

for an upgrade so at this point 240 per night and was sent to a different building with just minor better look Could not believe it was worth 230 euros per night At the end gave up the view to get a

the selected venue for our conference so it made sense to stay at the same hotel What i realised later on is that it was a waste of Money This hotel is rated 4 stars where i would personally rate them 2 5 or at most 3 stars I honestly wish i have gone with another hotel that is closer to city than this hotel The swiss brand is not reflected on this hotel at all I had the executive double room which was on the top floors 19th yet it was so small and normal it didn t reflect any executive feeling at all I ve checked out the other rooms and they are the exact same except the other room doesn t have access to what they call the executive lounge which to be honest is not worth it as they have nothing to offer in that lounge they had 3 kind of belgium wine on the happy hour and some nibbles finger food which is not that good at all The service at the lounge is so bad you feel like it s some kind of scam if you think of the amount of money you are paying for such service room when it comes to the room again the room decore is very basic and looks like they had that formica covered fake wood which made things look so cheap and very ugly The bedside tables had no drawers there is just no enough storage space in that room which is ironic as the swiss are known to have very good designs that is functional and smart yet this hotel represent the opposite The bathroom was not smart either the shower water pressure is very low you feel like you are in a 3rd world country They only provide shower gel and shampoo nothing more than that which is strange for an executive room i would have expected they would provide a toothbrush and some more toiletries such as little perfume or even proper organic hand wash or even s loofah or a shaving kit like any 4 normal start At the end you feel like you are not getting your money s worth </br></br>Negative: The bed was so bad i had to ask for a mattress topper and they came to put in mattress cover which didn t make the mattress feel better The cleaning services didn t do a good job I had breadcrumbs on the floor for 3 days and the cleaners didn t even think of vacuuming the room as they knew that i was there for 7 days The pathetic minibar had couple of fisi drinks such as coke and some apple and beer which i don t drink they didn t even offer fresh juice so you basically pay for something you don t even use as the minibar is paid for already with this type of room The nespresso coffee machine was nice to have in the room but what i didn t like is the capsules they offered their own cheap version of capsules It would have been better if they just offered nespresso own capsules which is the best They also were very stingy with water bottles i received only 2 small bottles each day one would think if you get an executive room there would be 2 bottles in the bathroom and 2 in the room at least yet that was another disappointment I would not recommend this hotel to anyone </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Netherlands

excellent if pricey meal and service in the Silk Road Restaurant </br></br>Negative: After our excellent dinner the night before breakfast was very disappointing The selection was limited for the size of hotel and the quality of product not great Having prepaid the breakfast and already had reception query it but sort it out at check in when we arrived for breakfast we were made to wait 10 minutes while they sorted it out and confirmed AGAIN that yes we had indeed pre paid for it very unprofessional for a top name hotel The glasses for orange juice etc were tiny so my husband took a large wine glass and filled that but was told he couldn t use them and when he asked the waiter to please bring four of the small glasses to the table as he likes a large glass of orange juice in the morning the waiter said I don t do table service Really A waitress appeared with a paper cup for my husband to have his orange juice in this is not the standard of service we expect from this level of hotel It seemed there were plenty of staff but standing around and not serving or circulating with orange juice coffee etc We told the reception staff on check out who were really apologetic about it and gave my husband a bar of Movenpick chocolate by way of apology Unfortunately due to the location of the hotel there is nowhere else nearby for breakfast </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom

hotel again on my next trip to Amsterdam </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United States of America </br></br>Positive:  I loved the location of this hotel Basically right next to Rembrandtplein which offers access to restaurants bars and clubs but tucked away enough to mitigate the loud partiers tourist from the square at night The staff are great and rooms are clean and more spacious than most hotels in Amsterdam </br></br>Negative: The wifi could be improved Basically only fast enough to use messaging apps like whatsapp but you ll find it s too slow to stream videos You can get a code

in the hotel </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Australia </br></br>Positive:  Stayed here many times now and the location is unbeatable Right next to Rembrandt square but because of double glazed

property Also I was provided a special high speed internet connection other than the usual free wifi for no extra charge Much appreciated for the gesture </br></br>Negative: The staff at check out seemed rather disinterested in the job Instead of asking how was your stay the first thing she uttered was EUR 345 please card or cash Very impersonal and unsmiling After this she reluctantly said

great for my purpose unsure if it might be the best place for doing tourism though The room was tidy and well equipped I certainly would return and do recommend the hotel </br></br>Negative: Besides the price which might be regular for Amsterdam it certainly is a great place I have to admit that 9 for a beer and an additional charge of 7 50e for room service as an add on to the already high price were a bad surprise </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Bed was comfortable and location wasn t too bad if you were happy to walk Decent restaurants about a 10 minute walk away</br></br>Negative: Not 5 star quality at all in need of a refresh in the rooms and all other services Stated that it has gym facilities however this was across the road and you had to

would be grateful if they could give me a room to be covered for the whole stay they advised that was not going to be a problem and gave me a folder for the key to a room for the whole period of 3 nights However on Sunday morning when I was having breakfast a receptionist approaches me and advises that I have to leave the room as the third night paid by me is a different type of room smaller and less expensive I find this unbelievable first to interrupt the client having breakfast and secondly of course the problem which I had signaled at arrival I would happily have stayed at the less expensive alternative for the whole stay in order not to have changed room It is unbelievable that reception personnel can make these types of errors at a hotel with supposedly a high standard </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Switzerland </br></br>Positive:  Food at their restaurant is fantastic All bartenders were really friendly and service in general reception restaurant bar was

missed my flight and was in no condition to travel I asked to stay a little longer The hotel insisted that I rang my wife at home and got her to email copy passport copy credit card etc or they were going to throw me out on the street penniless I am registered disabled by the way as I have difficulties moving both arms holding things walking more than 200 yards or so and I m due to have an operation next week to try to reduce the pain Some people assume wrongly that it is alcohol or drug related The hotel repeatedly told my wife that the theft was our problem not their s and the lady

could not sort it out then and the guy told me to take a seat and come sort it out in a min as I was holding the que up I suffer with severe panic attacks and anxiety I started to cry and panic as all staff looked at me as if I was doing something bad My mental health was quite bad so decided to go on holiday as its my birthday Monday and I m turning 24 I booked wig Victoria as I go to Amsterdam a lot on business and to see friends The moment I arrived at the hotel I felt unwelcome and unwanted and kept being told to take a seat so the other guests could not see me cry eventually after panic I handed my phone over to the receptionist who told my mother who I ring in panic that I could not use her card for the deposit I was told he would just take today s money but I didn t want to just book for one day Incase I didn t have it sorted the next day and if I wanted to get up before check out I eventually had the money transferred and felt the staff to be extremely unhelpful and rude unlike when I stayed the first time This was not a great start to my holiday and paying 5 euro for a can of drink for the mini bar is not what I expected either I was not pleased with the room as there was a step infront of the door and I tripped falling into the door and hurting my head The second day after popping outside for some lunch and a ciggettette I arrived to the whole road being shut with no

bring it into the 21st century Staff was rather arrogant than service oriented starting with the check in and ending with the concierge But the clue was that you have to beg if you want to use the rest rooms in the lobby area They are locked by card to avoid tourists using them which is understandable But I believe the easiest way would be to contract more people controlling the access to the

helping at all and mainly not providing any solution at all She said that she have to ask her manager and that the manager was outside and will return 4 hours later At the beginning i tried to find the pin but when that wasnt possible i asked them at least to cancel the reservation so that i could get a new hotel Again she wasnt doing that as well To make things short i had to wait 1 5 hours in the lobby without knowing if i have a room and without any answer from them When i really couldnt wait any more and forced the reception to take an action she told me that i could stay for 1 night my reservation was for 2 days and that tomorrow they will answer what will happen Amsterdam was really full and the options for hotels were really limited i had to go to a long day in work and there i was without knowing if i will have a hotel the next day or not Please just imagine how was that experience The next day i couldnt sleep since i was waiting an answer from them i literally couldnt sleep since i had to find a solution by 7 am but they still didnt do anything The night reception guy was again unwilling to help and told me to wait the morning team The morning reception was at

get to the central station you need 15 min walk and 20 in the metro </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Israel </br></br>Positive:  It has a nice nature next to it and is located on the riverfront The staff is what makes it a bit better than what it is </br></br>Negative: The hotel is far from anywhere and even to get the public transportation you have to walk 10 minutes It is for groups travelling in organized trips and not for lone travelers as you will spend lots of money on Taxi or will have to rent a car The balconies are connected and door locks to the balcony broken harming your self security feeling After 10 oclock you will either have tpo travel to the city paying back and forth 60 euros for a taxi or you will stay hungry as there is no more food is served You can always order online a meal like I did but I do not recommend as I had to wait for an hour and the food quality was bad</br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Arab Emirates </br></br>Positive:  The room space</br></br>Negative: The lady at the reception was very rude I gave her my passport for check in and after she done she through it on the pench which is not polite at all I felt that she served me with force wishing not too During checkout I requested 30 min extra they said it would cost 20 euros and their reply not in respectful way Plus the location is bad as it is 10 min walk from the nearest public transportation such as the metro Noting is around the hotel in term of facilities Not recommended option</br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Netherlands </br></br>Positive:  Clean modern

</br></br>Positive:  The food I got was ok average The waiting staff were pleasant but not that knowledgable about the hotel and what it offers </br></br>Negative: Terrible value for money and a terrible location Arrived 5 minutes after the restaurant closed to check in The website did not state a closing time for the restaurant and I had based my decision on that but the kitchen closes at 10pm I was told at reception that I could still order pizza at the bar but by the time I got to the bar after the barman ran to the kitchen as I arrived I was told that next month we offer this until 1am but not now sorry The best I got was an offer of a take away that would take 40 50 minutes to arrive The hotel is too remote to go anywhere else for food As staff would not offer any help I m sure there was food in the kitchen I ended up buying chocolate from reception at an extortionate price The hotel is not at all easily accessible by public transport it is actually outside the city limit The last metro stop is closed so you have to get a shuttle bus to it There is then no footpath so you will have to walk over grass to get to the nearest path and walk down a lonely road for ten minutes to get to the hotel The hotel will not order a taxi for you I asked and was refused apparently taxis won t take such a short journey I asked for the manager the morning after all of this and she was completely unhelpful I basically got a shrug but no apology I was expected to know that I should walk through the car park of the Planetarium to get to the footpath when there was no signage Despite paying a lot of money breakfast was not included in the rate and the room was pretty average The front of the hotel advertises it as a 4 star not sure if this is correct I would never stay

the ground floor offers nice food </br></br>Negative: As most hotels in central Amsterdam they are overpriced This hotel is no exception To pay an extra EUR29 per day for the breakfast buffet on top of the already high room rate is just ridiculous The buffet did not look that great to suggest such exorbitant rate would be justified I only had breakfast in the hotel one morning and instead just had breakfast for less than half the price in one of the cafes nearby Or simply grab some nice food and a coffee from one of the nearby bakeries The room was overlooking one of the streets with restaurants and bars so Thu Sun night usually means drunk people yelling off the top of their voices until 5am in the morning The room s windows weren t sealed that well to cancel out the noise In fact the first night I got up twice to check that all the windows were closed completely which they were but it was just that noisy </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United States of America
