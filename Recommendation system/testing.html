enjoy the breakfast Rooms are ok have everything that you need </br></br>Negative: As windows are facing the courtyard it can be a little bit noisy in the evening or early morning but it depends how loud the guests are The only annoying thing was that guests were allowed to smoke in the courtyard and all the smell went to the room also it s not nice to eat breakfast when someone smokes nearby </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Denmark </br></br>Positive:  Good value for money great location </br></br>Negative: No serving other than breakfast Courtyard could be really cozy if cleaned up

within a 10 minute walk of the main central sites and public trasport but on a quiet charcaterful historic street The hotel itself is an historic building with a lovely quiet central courtyard and the

charm some historic features a nice breakfast room and courtyard and is in a fantastic location Staff helpful and speak good English Beds were comfortable and room adequately equipped Good selection at breakfast during the week days </br></br>Negative: Superior room suggested ironing facilities but that just meant borrowing the iron and board from Reception Bacon and fresh summer fruits strawberries etc strangely absent from Saturday and Sunday s breakfast buffet when they had been available in the week and staff were less likely to replenish supplies generally it was like they d clocked off for the weekend Unfortunately this presents guests with an imbalanced service penalising weekend visitors Biggest gripe though was towels and loo roll both of which were poor quality and rough Towels weren t changed during 4 night stay and one also had fake tan or makeup ingrained from an earlier user slightly making me question whether they d been washed at all before I arrived Just a few small negative points that could easily be rectified but they let the overall experience down </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Norway </br></br>Positive:  Location is great staff is very

</br></br>Negative: The mattress was not comfortable nor were the floppy saggy pillows and there was no top sheet just a comforter The worst thing was that the bathrooms had a bad smell I assume the plumbing is very old I had to change room because of it and while the second one didn t smell as much of sewage as the first one it did have a slight bad smell Really unpleasant I had to keep the door closed at all times and spend as little time as possible in the bathroom Finally the Wifi quality was terrible in both rooms I stayed in It was not possible to video Skype or video Facetime and even audio Facetime kept breaking up Really frustrating Overall the hotel is old and tired and really in need of refurbishment Definitely not a 4 star hotel I would not go back </br><hr>Nationality of

impolite Firstly I requested a queen size bed but got a room with twin beds I called the reception the lady over the phone was very impolite just said she will send over a colleague and cut the line Her colleague came by and said there s nothing he can do and just pushed the two beds together After coming back from dinner I was about to get into bed when I found bugs crawling under the pillow it was horrific to think I would ve slept in that bed if I hadn t moved the pillow I immediately called the reception requesting a room change the reception sent someone over to give me the keycard for the new room I received no apology whatsoever had to drag all my luggage to the new room without help and spent the rest of the night worrying about the cleanliness of the bed Well trained and polite

are carrying heavy bags </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Ireland </br></br>Positive:  Location and breakfast</br></br>Negative: Normally this hotel delivers but this time my experience was marred by no response from room service or bar to order food eventually went down to bar where it was not overly busy and placed my order although delivered in reasonable time did not feel like room service as I has not planned on leaving room Secondly as is often my custom I check out before eating breakfast and inform staff upon checkout that I will be eating breakfast after I finished breakfast I was presented with the check and passed my credit card to pay for it after nearly ten minutes the waiter returned asking for cash as his machine wasn t working he then asked for my card so he could take it down to reception on another floor and charge it there I refused stating that I would take care of it myself when finished I then went to reception and tried to pay but they didn t know what to do at which time I informed them I was going to pack and would take care of it on way out 15 mins later I returned ready to leave and they refused to take my payment stating that the waiter needed to come to the desk with my flight departure time rapidly approaching I told them I needed to leave in 1 minute after another 5 mins it was finally taken care of this left a very bad experience in my mouth lesson for mgmt if your staff are absent for whatever reason don t make excuses and don t inconvenience the customer because of your mistakes </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Netherlands

improved</br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Slovakia </br></br>Positive:  Interesting design in the room Good location close to the main railway station Breakfast o k although quite expensive</br></br>Negative: Some restrictions on wifi caused that it did not work for business purpose VPN connection was refused which works on standard wifi s in hotels </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Serbia </br></br>Positive:  I loved the lobby Sitting in the big chairs in the glass windows while it s snowing outside pure magic The lobby is offering books to read and souvenirs to buy The breakfast is served there which was delicious and various And it s a kind of smart bar in the evening Location is good The train station is there lot of tramb stations around Belvedere Museum is at the walking distance Super friendly and helpful staff Smart TV guidance and a lot of implemented useful information Very very clean </br></br>Negative: The rooms are budget looking even though the design is fun and cheerful The sealing need repainting Looks really old and dirty No phones in the rooms no room service you can t get information if you need one unless you go down to the reception Which is not so practical if you just went out from the shower No iron and ironing board which can be very bad if you are travelling for business I did business and extended few days for sightseeing Luckily I didn t have to iron anything Cloths storage is completely open which is kind of nice design but you need at least one compartment closed Tooth paste was sold not provided for 3 e The same one costs 1 e in the shops Not about the price but about overall impression No slippers Only shower gel not shampoos are provided For a 4 star hotel I would be expecting all of the above provided </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Slovakia </br></br>Positive:  Good starting point to explore the city station just a few meters away I love the mix of modern and classic breakfast ok for a short stay Self booking </br></br>Negative: Parking facilities bigger selection of breakfast which is not included in a price and there was no possibility to choose the option while booking </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United States of America </br></br>Positive:  Liked the bed and the shower They provided shower gel Nice lobby They can book your airport transfer The train station is in the area w a bakery cafe the tram is close too </br></br>Negative: They did not provide lotion Breakfast is a bit pricey at 10Euro but they have a lot of options </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  France </br></br>Positive:  A comfortable room and the buffet breakfast was great So was the lounge area bar in the lobby </br></br>Negative: The hotel is situated in a new steel and glass urban development that is still not finished The streets are empty and it doesn t feel like Vienna at all The only advantage of the location is its proximity to the rail station It is close to a tram station which gets you to downtown Vienna in 10 15 minutes However you can t really walk outside your door and feel like you re in Vienna </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Israel </br></br>Positive:  very nicely designed and the automation of check in makes things very fast and easy it is quite close to the main train station so getting to and from the city center is quite easy</br></br>Negative: I could have used a kettle in the room instead of having to go down for hot water The wi fi kept on cutting off and when i booked it was really unclear that breakfast was not included </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Taiwan </br></br>Positive:  A couple of surprises than typical hotel As I walking in I thought this is not the hotel lobby but a cafe almost going out of the door in searching the right lobby but was greeted by someone confirming this is the lobby Another surprise when I walked in the room the interior of my room was different from most other typical hotel with its unique decor of many special designs A bucket as waste basket too clean to be a trash can a wood box for luggage stool too strong for any travel luggage but at right size a long wood seat or couch next to window with a coffee table too good for an afternoon escape with coffee and a book in hand not to mention two metal stands act as bedside table ps still didn t comprehend how it should be worked Morning breakfast is another comfortable fresh apple carrot banana etc ready for self made morning veggie drink Other typical breakfast item are there scramble egg ham not too many selections but quite plenty Most importantly it is at a very convenient location near Vienna Train station and U Bahn </br></br>Negative: Toilet is just toilet It would be nice to have a shelf or something I almost drop by iPhone into it </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Italy </br></br>Positive:  Great and clean room modern forniture Staff was really kind and helpful also if I disagree with the hotel payment rules </br></br>Negative: They asked me an extra charge 30 euros for entering in advance in the room the first morning This never happened to me usually the hotels allow the entrance as soon as the room has been cleaned The breakfast is really good but too expensive When I went to the check out they told me that my credit card had already been charged I did not allowed them to use my credit card I gave the card number to Booking only in case of no show but never allow them to any other payment I was ready to pay with cash I think they should ask at the check in which payment method the guest prefers </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Czech Republic </br></br>Positive:  Breakfast choice size of the room bathroom nice decorations in the hotel </br></br>Negative: The

style It is impressive and beautiful Clean room very good breakfast WiFi worked with no issues </br></br>Negative: Cold behaving of the reception s staff by totally relaying to the automated check in system and invoice sending via email Moreover I was unhappy with very unusual practice of charging of my Master card immediately during the check in but the invoice I received via email 2 days later and 5 hours after I left the hotel The invoice was confusing with several unclear items but unfortunately I couldn t complain since I was already 5 hours away from the hotel In addition they charged my Master card with correct amount but 4 times in smaller chunks where 3 time in Euro currency and 1 time in HRK currency This was very confusing to me once i got Master card listing from my bank </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Germany </br></br>Positive:  Super charming low budget Hotel Good location for jogging </br></br>Negative: No fridge in the room</br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:

of space with a little seating area The location is good and easy to walk around directly to the museum quartier </br></br>Negative: At the level I was paying for I expected a bit more I was particularly surprised that there was no consistent wifi in the room sometimes none at all I was on a higher floor so I presume just my bad luck to be far away from wherever the signal is dispensed from But this is the first hotel in a long while that I ve had that issue and it is inconvenient There was an electric kettle to boil water but no instant coffee or tea or other amenities offered </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Turkey </br></br>Positive:  Cold water with lemon in lobby is perfect </br></br>Negative: That hotel is not cost effective You can find better hotel with that price or can find half of the price as same hotel Room is too small and internet connection doesn t work very well Some of rewivers written about location is perfect Vienna is too small city and location is how can be problem My firm had paid the hotel before my accomadation when i was check out hotel want to extra 3 euro for city tax Its the first time I saw payment extra city tax I had belived to

picture of it Nice large double bed Big enough and clean room and bathroom Convenient location quite central Friendly and helpful staff Wifi was working fine </br></br>Negative: Although I had placed the Do not disturb card outside of my door the cleaner ignored it and simply got into my room 8 00 in the morning and scared me to death The way I woke up at that day and the time really who starts cleaning the occupied hotel rooms at 8am ruined my mood for the whole day Luckily enough I was at least wearing my pazamas The hot water had no pressure at all and I was struggling to have a shower and even more to wash my long hair The room was very hot since the weather was warm and the aircon not yet functioning in May </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  South Africa </br></br>Positive:  Clean

hotel staff I met were very nice and helpful </br></br>Negative: The wifi was the worst I ever came across and I had my share of 4 hotels It kept indicating a good signal but if my iPad would connect at all most of the times kept on trying to do so the connection will be lost again within a minute or so This not only made it absolutely impossible to work in my room but was also getting frustrated For that reason I would not recommend this hotel for business travelers Another problem was the soundproofing in my room My windows were just above the tram line which kept rattling them all through the night Finally free access to the wellness suite was included but the door lock was broken i assume and would not accept my key card On all occasions I wanted to use it I had to get downstairs to the reception in my robe and ask for an attendant to come and let me in When you have only a limited time window to relax in between work and dinner with business partners having to do all the extra exercise was not ideal </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Russia </br></br>Positive:  My stay at the Hotel Maria Theresia was very pleasant the place provided everything I prefer neither big nor small no embarrassingly posh decoration very comfortable and clean two elevators Special thanks to the personnel for their friendliness and the wonderful atmosphere My room on the first floor was spaceous

Switzerland </br></br>Positive:  The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful This is a lovely quiet hotel just between the museums quarter and the Spittelberg Christmas market and so only a few minutes away from the fabulous Hofburg palace and complex the Parlament building and so many other architectural wonders Highly recommended </br></br>Negative: Follow the address Kirchberggasse rather than the location as it appears on googlemaps which fooled me into thinking the hotel is on the next street along </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Germany </br></br>Positive:  I asked for a double

system He told to us that there haven t any vacant room but we had done our booking 2 months before It was a very unpleasent situation Finally he gave to us one room At the morning everything was clear this room was our booked room how can one hotel to allow itself such a situation There was similar situations more I dont suggest this hotel when you want a quik understand frinedly staff When you want ask about the city about the transportation The personell there is VERY UNCOOPERATIVE </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Canada </br></br>Positive:  The location was amazing Steps from all

perfect for my needs 5 minutes walk from the Museums Quarter and less than that to the nearest underground station </br></br>Negative: Prices were higher than surrounding bars restaurants though I suppose that s expected They tried to charge me a city tax which I had already paid at the start and even had the wrong credit card number on file for me no idea whose that was The only view was of a different part of the hotel </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Australia </br></br>Positive:  Nice location handy to U Bahn and walking distances from central city and most sights Good breakfast buffet </br></br>Negative: Lifts sometimes a little slow Coffee nothing special standard for a hotel breakfast </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United States of America </br></br>Positive:  Perfect stay Great breakfast well located attentive staff No problem was too big or too small for the hotel staff to resolve While other hotels are closer to the heart of Vienna nothing beats the cost value and the quality of the service provided plus the hotel is right next to some of the biggest museums in the city plus the Hofburg Palace is just a short walk away I have stayed in many hotels in Vienna in the last 7 years and this one is my favorite by far </br></br>Negative: Nothing to complain about I would definitely stay here next time in Vienna </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  China </br></br>Positive:  Location is super Everything in walking distance but remain a quiet evironment Breakfast with fresh fruits and fried mushroom which I like very much Bed is clear and comfortable

</br></br>Positive:  I really liked the comfort of the bed and general conditions of the hotel The staff was very polite and attentive Location although not in the very center of the city but gives you a chance of a very pleasant 10 15 minutes walk to the main attractions The barman Vladimir was very polite to serve me 5 minutes past midnight although he was closed already Breakfast was not bad

alla peperoni sauce was completely tasteless and eating gnocchi was like chewing glue My daughter ordered spaghetti alla puttanesca came with a lot of very dry tuna but no anchovies and hardly any sauce Both inedible and sent back at least the waiter apologised and didn t charge the main courses Must have a new cook which might expalin why it was only half full Great Hotel but eat elsewhere </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United States of America </br></br>Positive:  I have stayed at this hotel 3 times now and overall I really enjoy it Its close to the Subway The rooftop bar is a great place to start the night but wished it stayed open later the pizza at the 1500 restaurant is great but it would be nice to expand the choices I was also glad to see that the Spa is included now

hotel is very well located near the Westbannof and near 2 subway stations It is on Mariahilfer street which has plenty of restaurants and cafes Shopping on that street is also excellent Breakfast at the hotel was expensive so I didn t use it and instead had breakfast in the street Excellent choice of hotel overall and I recommend it </br></br>Negative: At 17 Euros per person the breakfast was considered to be too expensive They had coffee in the room however which made it better The rooms were on the small side but adequate for one person In my booking somehow the mini bar was free which was an added benefit </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Malaysia </br></br>Positive:  1 City transport ticket provided 2 Convenient location </br></br>Negative: 1 Although room was quiet noise from

September in Vienna the room was freezing This is unacceptable in a 4 star hotel Further the breakfast hall on the 2nd floor is crowded and seating is limited and the buffet definitely is not worth the high price </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Czech Republic </br></br>Positive:  Everything was perfectly clean and location was amazing </br></br>Negative: We had business room with high speed

Location was good as many stores out there on the street to shop and eat also close to West train station </br></br>Negative: The house keeping came to ask the service we said no as we re checking out that morning An hour later around 10am someone just opened our door and came in for cleaning it was unbearable as we told them not to and also we checked out soon The hotel really needs to do something to connect reception and house management team so they can have info which room is checking out on the day in order to prevent disturbing the guests Also those staffs are needed to have proper training </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Poland </br></br>Positive:  Location is very good A 100 meters from the metro stop and since hotel gives free tickets for the whole duration of the

largest shopping area a metro station U3 Westbanhof exit inner Mariahilfer Stse and several tram lines which makes it excellent in terms of location The free transport ticket provided by the hotel does make a big difference as you can put it in your pocket and forget about it which means you can easily move anywhere in Vienna in a matter of minutes Going downtown takes no more than 10 minutes There is also supermarket right in front of the hotel and several restaurants nearby Rooms are good size and sound insulation is good Moving to and from the Airport is also quite easy either through the CAT train it doesn t arrive directly but there is a quick link through the U3 metro line </br></br>Negative: The official rating is four stars but I would say it is more like a three star hotel Staff was a bit of a hit and miss Some of them were good and friendly but others were not particularly helpful I am not sure whether it was a cultural issue but we felt some of them were a bit sarcastic when dealing some of our requests The manager should train them better on how to deal with the clients Breakfast has a good choice and was frequently replenished but it is not appropriate for people with food allergies as everything gets mixed and there is little care in separating the different items Finally a general complaint about hotels in Vienna I am not sure why but they do not seem to have the concept of a family room We were two adults and two children and had to get a special apartment that costed more than having two individual rooms which would have been inconvenient

which I was offered was to work from the Hotel s business center which turned out to be 2 old computers in a freezing cold corner of the Hotel s hall next to the entrance door In the room the curtains

breakfast Good location close to metro Westbahnhof If you do not want to travel from the airport by several subway lines that is a direct bus Approx about 0 5 hours whatever you choose bus or train metro Although it is necessary to take the evening rush hour into account since bus goes round the Cityhall in the center and stops frequently The staff at the reception is friendly Breakfast is acceptable BUT 1 Room size is specified with a shower square so suitable for a single person Two are already to be a bit crowded because of angles Interesting solution with a shower at the center of a room It wasn t good or bad for me BUT 2 This hotel as many others in Vienna offers apples in rooms and other places BUT 3 Sauna is in the hotel it s size is sufficient for 4 persons BUT 4 </br></br>Negative: 1 Unfortunately there is just one warm offer at breakfast sausages and scrambled eggs only although the same class hotels in Vienna offer a much larger selection 2 Keep in mind that for families with children or unfamiliar people it is better to avoid such an offer since glass cabin are without curtain although it is in the photo Anyway it seems not very convenient My room wasn t supplied with teapot and related items tea coffee 3 Apples in the hotel were the most tasteless In addition at second and following days apples were haven t served any more In sauna it all were completely rotten although after my remarks it were replaced 4 Turkish sauna is completely useless it does not work as it should slippers are not available so you need to bring your own so not to walk barefoot In general it is nothing to do for more than half an hour in sauna You can stand under a power shower but huge pools are forming on the floor then so you may feel ashamed with other guests

exposed through glass to the room You may have no problem about it if you are solo traveler or in other situations but just important piece of info in some case The location is not actually in the

The breakfast buffet is outstanding I loved it </br></br>Negative: The receptionist seemed to have a bad day From my side I felt a arrogant and superior attitude towards me which is the worst feeling as you just arrive and it is late a receptionist cannot have this attitude The first impression was lost Wednesday late evening at around 10pm I was put in a room which is usually for disabled people so the washroom looks unfamiliar The room was clean and actually quite nice Of course it would have been great to be in a regular room At least the receptionist could have mentally prepared me for that but he also failed on that point Its a irrational point that I am making here but this stuff counts when dealing with customers Things like that add up if the first moment was lost

buffet The friendly staff The bathroom although it was small </br></br>Negative: The carpet in the hallways needed to be replaced The towels were of poor quality too thin and small This was surprising in a hotel of this calibre Also no washcloth was provided </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Greece </br></br>Positive:  The location and the staff were highlights as was the spacious breakfast room with three rooms Everything worked most of the time and when there were questions or requests they were dealt with immediately It was particularly nice that there was always a deep bowl full of apples at the front desk I especially liked the view of St Peter s Cathedral from the window of my room </br></br>Negative: Housekeeping forgot to put towels in the room and a plastic garbage bag but each happened only once in a six night stay In addition the problems were swiftly taken care of The air conditioning was o k but somehow needed adjustment part of the time On occasion there was a loud sound which might have come from the plumbing or air conditioning Potential guests should know that the hotel does not offer food after breakfast but only drinks and snacks However there are many many restaurants and cafes very close to the hotel However all this was minor compared to the pluses I would definitely stay here again and again </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Everything was fine At check in the person handling the check in was helpful and organised the change of rooms so that I and my colleagues could have rooms with air conditioning for extra cost of course All the staff at Wandl are friendly and helpful </br></br>Negative: The WIFI connection is not very good particularly if you are on the higher floor I was on the 5th floor I had difficulty with WIFI connections to my laptop While having a room on a higher floor sounds good it is is better to be on a lower floor and stay very close to the MODEM and Server to ensure good WIFI connections The only way I could use my laptop was to sit in the bar area The other point is when making a reservation through Booking com it is not made clear or obvious on the Booking com site that not all the rooms at Wandl come with air conditioning I only found this out at check in I then requested to change to rooms with air conditioning for which we had to pay extra I accepted the additional cost but I think Booking com needs to make clear that not ALL rooms have air conditioning </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Israel </br></br>Positive:  Actually everything is great Breakfast is rich wifi super quick stuff the friendliest in the world </br></br>Negative: Room in which I was staying was kinda tiny But frankly it is okay</br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Poland

were all very helpful and friendly Wandl also provides a computer and printer for guest s use which is very helpful and convenient Definitely recommend Hotel Wandl </br></br>Negative: The problem is the WIFI connection is not very good in the room and to use my laptop I needed to come into the reception lounge area </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Location is Ok but in the middle of a number of building sites so very noisy </br></br>Negative: The staff were appalling The night porter was very drunk so difficult to check out at 7 am The broadband is non

was beautifully decorated with high quality bathroom and toilet rooms Excellent design throughout the room I would have enjoyed many more nights there </br></br>Negative: I think it is a serious problem that the rooms are not air conditioned The type and look of the hotel would imply a c so it is an unpleasant surprise in a hot day to find out it does not have a c Nevertheless the room was very pleasant and I appreciated that the person at the reception upgraded my room to one with a street view Thank you </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  pleasant

friendly and did everything they could to help me with whatever I needed The location is great in the heart of the city close to most of the sightseeing spots and to the U bahn and Wien Mitte </br></br>Negative: I had a single bed room and it was too small something like a dormitory room It was not bad but still not comfortable enough for the price </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Russia

simple and oldfashioned</br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Australia </br></br>Positive:  All but one staff member was very helpful and went out of their way to accommodate my requirements The hotel itself is very grand and I loved the period features Breakfast was wonderful and the decor was beautiful The bathroom was beautifully appointed and very clean despite being the size of a shoebox </br></br>Negative: To be told that a turnaround time of 8 hours for dry cleaning wa absolutely impossible was very disappointing when I walked to the dry cleaner myself at 9 30am and was told the item could be collected in as little as 4 hours The staff member made no effort to assist even though I made my desperation very clear She really let down my experience despite every other staff member being amazing My single room was tiny with a view of a brick wall I was unhappy about not being able to iron in my room When you travel for business this is not a luxury it is a necessity It was nice of the staff to allow me to iron downstairs but this was inconvenient </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Belgium </br></br>Positive:  Location Very friendly checkin Correct

a sightseeing of Vienna We even in the morning pointed out for the smoking rooms The booking form clearly states 2 smoking rooms When we came back for the check in at 3 PM they gave us the keys and wanted to send us away in our rooms since the lobby was full of people clearly waiting for check in at exactly 3 PM and not a minute earlier When I asked if the rooms are smoking they said Oh noooo we only have 3 smoking rooms and they are already taken When I tried to explain that we need smoking rooms not beacuse of caprice but beacuse of need the trainee at the reception not the receptionist said that s not her concern and not her problem If I knew that my booking request would not be met I would booked a hotel elsewhere a hotel with a terrace And the girl at the reception said Than wait

discount that was offered Wifi open and free without any fuss The staff was reasonably friendly </br></br>Negative: The hotel and the rooms are quite outdated and worn out The room decoration was sparse and had a cheap feel to it The shower was installed in a old bath tub which made it uncomfortable to shower Cleanliness was poor as I often found hairs from the cleaning staff on the floor and towels Also there was mold growing near the ceiling in the bathroom because of inadequate ventilation Breakfast seemed elaborate but the quality of the products was mediocre All in all this is not a 4 star hotel </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Romania </br></br>Positive:  Good breakfast The WiFi was reasonably fast good for work Chocolate on the pillow Small cake at entrance </br></br>Negative:

</br></br>Negative: I found hairs in my bed on the blanket as well as in the bathroom in tube and also on towels The hotel tries to look old fashioned and luxurious but the truth is it is more timeworn shabby and obsolete The corridors are smelly and the wardrobe is stinky </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Ireland </br></br>Positive:  Very good breakfasts Very close to tram underground stations Good location ideal for exploring old city on a foot Clean Quiet Good view from the window in my case </br></br>Negative: Bed was a bit on a hard side It might be my preference though I did

acceptable rate Breakfast Restaurant Overall standing of common areas</br></br>Negative: Used to be a palace victim of cheap renewals which destroyed a nice place But if fully renewed to the original level I could not afford I do not know what was visible through the window which was obscured by protections during outside facade cleaning </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United States of America </br></br>Positive:  Satisfactory rich breakfast in a nice and decent setting The extra padded door prevents much of the noise otherwise would come from the corridors Very close to the metro station </br></br>Negative: Generally the hotel looks it needs an overall restoration but there is always something nostalgic when you have to use an actual key to enter your room The quality of the bed was poor </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Characterful quite grand old hotel nicely located on a busy street but not particularly noisy even with top window open Good bar restaurant and breakfast clean with helpful staff I booked a single but was given a large double with a bath and a soundproofing door to the corridor Very pleasant stay </br></br>Negative: Nothing really </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Romania </br></br>Positive:  The Location is perfect Everything else was not so important </br></br>Negative: Single room was tiny and shabby Mould marks in

to the Schottentor subway station Vienna University Votiv kirche and generally within the walking distance from many landmarks The room is quite small yet clean However it is highly overpriced for Vienna </br></br>Negative: There was no WiFi reception in my room at all despite the promise on Booking com The staff claimed it was a temporary problem but as a matter of fact WiFi coverage doesn t cover all the rooms and if yours is further down the corridor you won t get the signal Since I was on a business trip that was a real dealbreaker And it goes without saying that the hotel refused to give me a different room with working wireless internet The room was rather tidy yet it definitely needed a renovation in certain areas Power outlets were rather wobbly and tended to follow the plug when I pulled it out Flush buttons in the restroom also were not properly secured in the wall Finally the hotel froze the full amount of money for my stay on my credit card four days before I even arrived despite the fact that the free cancellation was until one day before arrival And the money were released only after two weeks so for a period of time I was effectively double charged To summarize I would not recommend this hotel There are much cheaper and better offers in the area </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Germany </br></br>Positive:  The location of the Hotel is perfect

to disgusting the wallpaper is gross and the television was a CRT Additionally the room had two twin beds one next to the other instead of a double bed clearly requested during the reservation Good

in the room like humidity or some sort Asked what can be done about this and was told whether I would like to have a member of the staff to drop by and spray something Eventually I left the window open as much as possible On top of that there was some noise coming from the plumbing or similar Not sure what was that but the ceiling and walls were noisy in the middle of the night didn t enjoy that either Large variety in breakfast however I was disappointed with the quality E g the vegetables looked old dry the coffee mediocre The Wi Fi was bad one of the slowest ones I had to use in a

the time</br></br>Negative: 1st time in my life to see a 5 star hotel with no lobby if you wanna receive someone from outside or a visitor you either take him to your room or to the restaurant which occupies all the ground floor The reception is small and located in a small corner The roof of the room is not decorated and you see the concrete above your head u get a feeling that you are in a factory not a hotel No iron available in the room No coffee maker The staff in the 8th floor restaurant are not friendly at all especially at the breakfast time For instance no coffee machine there and you have to ask them to bring you which is still fine however when you ask them while taking your stuff they say rudely go to your table and someone will come to you there One day I finished my

good for lilliputians and exhibitionists as room is too small and shower is with transparent door If you wanna stay alone it maybe fine but for 2 people it will be too small Wooden shutters really wanna know who such a creative designer of this idea make you feel dead body in the very expensive coffin Breakfast doesn t cost such money plenty useless dishes not tasty at all Restaurant is nothing special price is too high for such level dishes services This hotel is good to stay for 2 3 nights for fun </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Stunningly presented hotel that makes an impression with their design choices as soon as you enter The top floor restaurant offers a superb view of Vienna s skyline as does the somewhat surreal pool The standard double room I stayed in struck a beautiful balance between brutalist design and Austrian elegance Don t expect much privacy if you re travelling as a couple The central shopping district is a short walk away

is an equestrian theme running throughout the hotel from the full size stuffed horse in the lobby to the leather items in the room The breakfast buffet is high class and the service excellent </br></br>Negative: The rooms are small which the designer has tried to offset by placing the shower and the wash basin assembly in the room itself rather than separately Only the toilet is separate There is a separate mini bar just for Champagne but no closet for clothes and not a single drawer for underwear etc Also not a single chair only a decorative horse carriage inspired in green leather bench that was rather uncomfortable The electric safe was out of order The lighting while artistic is illogically controlled making it difficult to say read and watch TV simultaneously

foods comparing to other hotels The rooms are clean and bright beds are comfortable towels are fluffy </br></br>Negative: The huge minuses for me were no WiFi in my room fifth floor Restarting the router didn t help at all so that was pretty disappointing As i need Internet for my work i will have to select another hotel next time in Wien Another point is that there was somebody smoking inside their rooms and the cigarette smell was all over the corridor and staircases although it is stated as a non smoking hotel This is not a fault of stuff though </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Hungary </br></br>Positive:  The hotel is at an excellent location The room and bathroom was big and very well equipped fridge microwave air conditioning hair dryer Thick curtains could be used to keep strong

outdated but clean The windows looked at the street which were busy with trams passing regularly under the windows therefore the room was very noisy I had to use earplugs for sleeping and I had to turn on the air conditioning instead of opening the windows It is not recommended for long stay although the room would be big enough </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  New Zealand </br></br>Positive:

appreciate the presence of a little kitchenette in the room microwave kettle fridge and sink Breakfast was also great especially the probably home made spreads Hotel is really close to a tram stop so

work it s basically a basic subscription that is shared among all the guests and staff It is fine if you use internet when nobody does but you can t use at any time in the evening I couldn t even download a pdf properly The breakfast is ok but still low standard compared to what you can get at this price in Vienna There was an uncomfortable remanent smell in the bathroom I just can t believe this hotel is still surviving with all the competitors and the Airbnb around I do not recommend I don t blame the staff they do the best they can with what they have it s just that the owner and the management are absolutely awful </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  France </br></br>Positive:  close to metro 5 min to the city centre by metro 2 stops and to the main railway station by metro 1 stop
