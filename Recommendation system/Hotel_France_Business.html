it is at least 10 minutes walk from the Champs lys es then my expectations are much higher and unforunately there were two key areas that I felt were lacking 1 The breakfast It is either 30 for a continental breakfast or 40 for full As always I opted for the continental However the selection and quality was very poor for this price point utensils and plates hard to find and the facilities such as the cereal dispenser and toaster not well maintained and not working properly Overall very disappointing especially as breakfast is what you do before checking out so is the last main memory I would recommend any guest if they have the time to skip breakfast here and search out a cafe or bakery somewhere nearby Wish I done that 2 My room was a little cold and this remained despite turning

kept insisting on paying the reservation regardless to what I told him Then he has been trying to join the night shift receptionist by telephone Finally the night shift receptionist had responded He claimed that it was a pre authorisation He did not apologise about this mistake I think that the night shift receptionist was not in wood to work so he had fabricated the story of the payment The

just miserable and rude It just created a bad feeling coupled with a smelly room whcih potentially has vermin lingering around The price was almost 150 euros a night which was ridiculous Don t anybody

their only option for relief was one of five fans available for the entire hotel Obviously I wasn t one of the lucky or quick ones and had to endure a room that was 84 degrees That may have been ok if I could open my window to let air in I did and until nearly 4 in the morning got to listen to the dance clubs and drunks from the massive station across the street One of my colleagues while enduring the opressive heat also woke up to ants crawling on him in his bed The hotel management refused to speak to our group and the rest of the staff was terribly rude I also didn t like the fact that staff kept telling us the air was fixed when 84 degrees on the top floor of the hotel clearly proved it wasn t Lastly having to change hotels in the middle of my trip doesn t rank at the top of things I

elsewhere </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Israel </br></br>Positive:  The breakfast is good in comparison to classic French breakfast a good selection of food for various demands A variety of mini

so quite noisy we did get a refund at the end to bring our pre payment in line with the cheaper room rate but they were not aware at the desk we had to spend time explaining what had happened no apology was offered We were asked wasn t a similar value room available Well how would we know Presumably not or you would have offered it we ve stayed at the hotel before without problem but it has put us off from re booking We re in Paris twice a year on business usually book a couple of rooms we know things go wrong but felt it could have been dealt with in a better way After we d been moved on our first night no one mentioned it as we re occupied all day for business didn t really have the time or inclination to ask about moving again to a better room as it was too much bother for us to

heard over clientele Ther were never more that 25 clients in the dining room at one time isiswas there for over 1 5 hours The hot food was cold and the layout and flow of the breakfast buffet is incredibly counter intuitive I would say arbitrary One of the staff had a loud and heated argument with a client and no manager or other staff made any effort to assuage the argument or resolve the issue The first day the food was cold and theb unattentive service was deplorable service staff stood around chatting amng themselves in 2s and 3s and would did not even take away my used dishes The only thing any staff did was to get me a mug of coffee when I first sat down from a machine yes I think I could have managed that by myself A woman was having trouble with the toaster no one went to help her if I could see this from across the room why didn t they see it So I decided to give the breakfast another try my second day because there was too much construction noise in my room again Not much improvement the eggs were a bit warmer than the day before As I was leaving 3 staff were standing chatting in the entrance where the podium is none of them would move out of the way so I could get past They just stood there looking at me like deer caught in the headlights 25 euro for the breakfast was a waste of money I do not like to give bad reviews but this one was unavoidable

front of me A business guy came late and passed in front of everybody else thanks to his Premium Membership This is offensive and makes you non premium member feel miserable The room was OKish But the decoration is old looking and dark The table is full of bumps and glitches The mini bar was empty The airco blowing noise and cold I could reduce a bit the fan but not switch it off So the next morning I had a headache The restaurant is in the huge lobby quite dark and not cosy at all so I went across the street to the Trattoria Bellagio Last but not least the Wifi was free but useless as

cloud yes I slept like a child if I used ear props </br></br>Negative: All sounds from the corridor could be heard in my room that is people walking and talking and closing doors and sound from the elevators I did not try to find out whether the sound came through the door with the canals in the air ventilation or maybe somehow else There was lot of noise from drilling machines and some other instruments from ten o clock in the morning but I realize that repairing work must sometimes been done so this is maybe the best time to start in the morning </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:

with everything you would need The staff particularly Florian at the front desk were exceptionally helpful and welcoming </br></br>Negative: A very minor thing but when I arrived the bed was made in a somewhat sloppy way When I woke in the morning I found a pair of socks in the bed that were not mine but looked as though they must have been laundered with the sheets </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Italy </br></br>Positive:  the comfortable bed the very kind and nice staff</br></br>Negative: the WC was smelly likely not had been cleaned properly no soap was available in the bathroom a part from shampoo shower gel in the shower the bedside tables were sticky and dirty an frequent annoying noise during all time probably coming from the elevator very limited breakfast</br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Australia </br></br>Positive:  Quality hotel in close proximity to the Gare du Nord and to the Sacr C ur Neighbour hood a little to be cautious about but fine The Wi Fi was down and I was offered a portable WIFI unit at a cheap price and it was super </br></br>Negative: Rooms a little small but scored room in the rear and was very quiet </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  France </br></br>Positive:  The hotel reception is smart and clean and the reception staff very helpful and friendly The hotel as a whole has a nice clean look to it The room was a decent size with a nice clean and well designed and made bathroom and tea coffee making facilities The curtains were almost total blackout and the soundproofing excellent The bed was very comfortable I have slept in a lot of Parisian hotel beds and this was one of the best I didn t have breakfast but the English lady I met in the lobby did and said that it was excellent I like this area Walk west and you arrive at a pleasant residential area with decent bars and eateries It s quiet and not touristy at all </br></br>Negative: I guess that the Bvd Barbes is not the coolest part of Paris though I like the exotic feel of the area around Chateau Rouge Metro If it makes you nervous get off the Metro at Marcadet Poissoniers and walk uphill It s not much further anyway </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Colombia </br></br>Positive:  The hotel is pretty basic Nothing trendy but it is OK and it is very close to the metro and to the Montmartre rea I would recommend it even if some people may find the neighborhood a little bit scary or uncomfortable </br></br>Negative: Rooms are not that nice and very small the bag hardly fits in it but the bathroom is good Breakfast is Ok but the dinning room is so tiny </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Brazil </br></br>Positive:  The room was comfortable but I booked a double just for myself The reception desk staff was very nice and helpfull Close to a metro station Chateau Rouge with access to the conference venue via RER B The price was fair considering the high demand for hotels close to Gare du Nord because of the COP21 conference </br></br>Negative: Not so clean breakfast wasn t good and the location is terrible a rough neighborhood very dirty street and rather unsafe </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  Stayed here for business trip for one night hotel itself is good it is the location that lets it down</br></br>Negative: Don t go out after dark this is a poor area to stay in there are people sleeping rough right outside the hotel not just one but lots Also lady s of the night are everywhere in the area if you want that great I m streetwise but I felt intimidated </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  United Kingdom </br></br>Positive:  The room was small but confortable</br></br>Negative: The staff that was at the reception desk at 11pm when I checked in that evening was the rudest person I have ever met First when I arrived he asked me what do you want in a rude manner Then gave me a lecture about not smoking in the room because if you do we will find out about it when I said politely that if I wanted to smoke I would do so outside the hotel no problem Then went on to give me a lecture about letting the cleaners do my room the next day because they have children and husbands to go back to and no time to waste Finally when I asked where was my luggage which I had left in their secure store room that morning he pointed out at my bag which was left in the corridor out of their sight and there available for anyone to open it and take my belonging out of it Absolutely shocking Will never stay in this hotel again and would recommend the managers to get rid of this person at the desk </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Spain </br></br>Positive:  Nice breakfast </br></br>Negative: Very strange neighbourhood May be it is safe but it doesn t look like Room very small and not very cozy </br><hr>Nationality of reviewer:  Mexico </br></br>Positive:  good breakfast close to metro</br></br>Negative: very slow internet no bath tube</p>";
