Piet Heinkade 11 Zeeburg 1019 BR Amsterdam Netherlands,338,4/20/2017,8.4,M venpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Australia , The bed was so bad i had to ask for a mattress topper and they came to put in mattress cover which didn t make the mattress feel better The cleaning services didn t do a good job I had breadcrumbs on the floor for 3 days and the cleaners didn t even think of vacuuming the room as they knew that i was there for 7 days The pathetic minibar had couple of fisi drinks such as coke and some apple and beer which i don t drink they didn t even offer fresh juice so you basically pay for something you don t even use as the minibar is paid for already with this type of room The nespresso coffee machine was nice to have in the room but what i didn t like is the capsules they offered their own cheap version of capsules It would have been better if they just offered nespresso own capsules which is the best They also were very stingy with water bottles i received only 2 small bottles each day one would think if you get an executive room there would be 2 bottles in the bathroom and 2 in the room at least yet that was another disappointment I would not recommend this hotel to anyone ,218, The main reason why i chose to stay at this hotel was mainly because it was the selected venue for our conference so it made sense to stay at the same hotel What i realised later on is that it was a waste of Money This hotel is rated 4 stars where i would personally rate them 2 5 or at most 3 stars I honestly wish i have gone with another hotel that is closer to city than this hotel The swiss brand is not reflected on this hotel at all I had the executive double room which was on the top floors 19th yet it was so small and normal it didn t reflect any executive feeling at all I ve checked out the other rooms and they are the exact same except the other room doesn t have access to what they call the executive lounge which to be honest is not worth it as they have nothing to offer in that lounge they had 3 kind of belgium wine on the happy hour and some nibbles finger food which is not that good at all The service at the lounge is so bad you feel like it s some kind of scam if you think of the amount of money you are paying for such service room when it comes to the room again the room decore is very basic and looks like they had that formica covered fake wood which made things look so cheap and very ugly The bedside tables had no drawers there is just no enough storage space in that room which is ironic as the swiss are known to have very good designs that is functional and smart yet this hotel represent the opposite The bathroom was not smart either the shower water pressure is very low you feel like you are in a 3rd world country They only provide shower gel and shampoo nothing more than that which is strange for an executive room i would have expected they would provide a toothbrush and some more toiletries such as little perfume or even proper organic hand wash or even s loofah or a shaving kit like any 4 normal start At the end you feel like you are not getting your money s worth ,386,3.3,"[' Business trip ', ' Couple ', ' Executive Double Room with City View ', ' Stayed 7 nights ']"
